Villavicencio                         Master of Arts in Technology Innovative Education                                                University of Makati                                                    May15, 2020                                                      ABSTRACT                   The developed Arduino-based laboratory experiments is           an attempt to suggest a supplementary laboratory          experiments for teaching and learning Physics. The laboratory          experiments were designed to augment the deficiency or          absence of Physics laboratories and/or tools and equipment.          Using the computers, Arduino boards, and electronics           components, students can perform at least twenty (20)          physics experiments, specifically on circuit, electricity, sound,          and light. Arduino microcontrollers can be converted as data          acquisition devices, power supply, analyzer, measuring device           and learning materials.                    On the other hand, Physics laboratory manuals of the          experiments developed were digitized and brought in          internet space through the use of Google Sites. The name of          the website is AB Physics RLab which stands for Arduino-           Based Physics Remote Laboratory. Using this site, both          teachers and students can view, access, and download the          learning materials through the aid of embedding the Google          Drive and Google Suite in the website.                    The developed Physics laboratory experiment           successfully passed the unit, integration, and system and          acceptance testing. 207 evaluators from 5 tertiary institutions          in the Province of Cavite evaluated the project.The project          got an overall mean of 4.63 for the quality of the hardware          used in the project, 4.64 for the internet-based manual and          4.68 for the quality-in-use of the project. The result of the           evaluation showed that in all criteria the project has a          descriptive rating of excellent. Therefore, the project can be          usedas an alternative instructional material in teaching-          learning Physics II for students under computing programs.
