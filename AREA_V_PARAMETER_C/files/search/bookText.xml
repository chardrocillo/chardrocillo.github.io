                            The   conversion   of   the   school   into   a   college   paved   the   way
                      for  expansion    of    its    academic    offerings.    In    response    to    the
                      challenges  of Project   CALABARZON,  schools   such  as   School   of   Arts

                      created  in  addition to the school of Agriculture in 1992.

                           In   1993,   in   recognition   of   its   potentials   and   achievements,
                      the college  was  designated  by  the  Department  of  Education,  Culture
                      and Sports   (DECS)   as   the   Regional   College   of   Agriculture   (RCA)
                      for     the  Southern  Tagalog  Region.           Being  the  RCA,  DSAC  was
                      mandated  to  assist  seven       (7)    Provincial    Technical     Institutes    of

                      important  historical  milestones  of  the  school. DSAC  was  converted

                      the   University   was   designated   by   the   Commission   on   Higher
                      Education  (CHED)  as           Center    of    Development    for    Agriculture
                      the Agricultural                and CHED  also  authorized  CvSU  to  be  a

                                                     INTRODUCTION

                             Research  at  the  CaviteStateUniversity  began  with  the  conversion
                      of IndangRuralHigh   School         into   DonSeverinoAgriculturalCollege         in
                      1964. Since     then  The  Research      Center  has  evolved  to  function  as
                      one  of  the trilogy  roles  of  the  University.   To  date,  the  University  is
                      the  seat  of  the national    research,    development    and    extension    for
                      coffee–a      status  bestowed       by    the    Department       of    Agriculture
                      Bureau   of   Agricultural Research.

                           The     Research        Center       (RC)     exerted      serious     efforts
                      towards streamlining       the    Research,     Development       and    Extension
                      Program      by  establishing   a  strong  and  effective   research   program
                      aimed  to  generate innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers
                      and other clienteles. This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their
                      standard    of    living.    The  University’s    research    program    focused    on
                      coffee    research,    development  and    extension.    However,    to
                      accommodate  the  ever  increasing  need  for RD&E  activities  brought
                      about  by  the  development  of  the  university  into a           comprehensive
                      one,    these    thrusts    have    become      more    elaborated through  the
                      “Faculty  and  Students  Research  Capability  Enhancement Program”
                      that  has  been  approved  by  the  University  Board  of  Regents  in 2004.

                              The    university    has    maintained    ties    and    established
                      collaborative projects    with    international    and    local    agencies    with

                                 1. Sources of Funds

                                        Financial    resources    are    generated    through
                                 international and     local     grants,     donations,          bilateral
                                 agreements     and collaborations   with   government   agencies,
                                 local    and     foreign  funding  institutions  and  other  research
                                 agencies and councils.

                                        There  are  two  major  classifications  of  fund  sources:
                                 the internal  and  external  funds.       The  internal  funds  come
                                 from  the general    appropriation    allocation    (GAA)    of    the
                                 Philippine government.   The  Center  also  generates  funds  from
                                 the    Income  Generating  Project  of  its  various  units.      On  the
                                 other  hand,  the  external    funds    come    from    government
                                 agencies    such    as    DA-  BAR,  PCARRD,  INIBAP,  and  STIARC
                                 as well as foreign agencies, private organizations and industry
                                 partners.

                                 2. Handling of Research Funds

                                        All    research       funds      are     handled       by     the
                                 Finance  Management          Office    in    coordination     with    the
                                 Office   of   the Director   of   Research.      Books   of   accounts
                                 are    kept    by    the  Accounting    Department    which    is   also
                                 under    the    supervision    of  the  Director  of  Administrative  and
                                 Support Services.

                                        Research  funds  that  are  externally  funded  are  pooled
                                 and treated     as   trust   funds.    The    Director    of   Research
                                 exercises general   control   over   all   these   research   grants.
                                 These     are  deposited    in    the    bank    as    trust    fund    lumped
                                 together    to    earn  interest.       Funds  are  released  to  the
                                 Accounting  Office  by  project  allotments.        The  project/study
                                 leaders handle all the processing of    papers    to    release    the
                                 fund    meant    for    their    research projects/studies.     Fund
                                 from    income    generating    projects    are  also  being  handle  by
                                 the  Accounting  Division  with  full  control  of  the  Research
                                 Director.

                                  The R and E planning process may involve the following:

                                   Assessment   of   environment.     Program   planning   which
                           is  done    by    R    and    E    management    in    coordination    with    the
                           RECETS  starts  with the  analysis  of  the  factors in  the  environment
                           relevant to the R and E programs. Environment factors refer to the
                           set of forces both  inside  and  outside  the  organization  that  affects
                           organization’s  performance    (Certo,    1994).              The    internal
                           environmental  factors  that can   be   considered   are   institutional
                           capacity,      structure,      support  system           (financial            and
                           administrative)      and      organizational management.

                                   Major  consideration  of  the  external  factors  can  be  focused
                           on the   political   and   national   policies,   laws   and   procedures   of
                           the government        as   well   as   the    development      programs      of
                           National  Development          Authority      (NEDA),       Department        of

                                        The Technology Assessment Protocol (TAP)

                                        Technology   assessment   is   an   important   aspect   of
                                 the whole  technology  development  process.   It  requires  the
                                 process of  anticipation  and  analysis  of  a  broad  range  of
                                 socio-cultural,  technical,    economic,    environmental    and
                                 political/legal   impact  prior    to    the    introduction    of    a    given
                                 technology  or  even  while  a specific        technology     is   being
                                 promoted.        The    success     of    the  technology    assessment
                                 depends    on    the    efficient    gathering    and  synthesis        of

                                 the organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at
                                 least five   (5)   members   with   two   basic   expertise   that   are
                                 critically needed:       a    technically    competent    expert    who
                                 knows        the  technology      and      the        commodity     being

                          Research Policies and Procedures

                          1. All    university    researches    (student    and    faculty)    have    to
                             be coordinated with the ResearchCenter.
                          2. There       should      be     an     approved        proposal        before    a
                             research
                             program/project/study can be conducted,
                          3. Student    researches    can    be    hooked    up    with    the    approved
                             research  program/project/study  of  a  faculty  member/research
                             leader.
                          4. The    researcher    shall    prepare    progress    reports    for    on-going
                             researches    and    terminal    report    for    completed    ones    and
                             present  them    during    the    in-house    review.    Failure    to    do    so
                             would  prompt the         Research       Director          to      evaluate
                             the              research  program/project/study    and    evaluate
                             continuation  or  termination of the research, as the case may be.
                          5. The  RDE  Council,  which  has  to  be  organized/constituted  and
                             with all   the   members   getting   functionally   involved,   shall   serve
                             as   a clearing house of all major activities of the ResearchCenter.
                          6. Techno        guides     have       to       be       appropriately       generated
                             through research.
                          7. The University Techno guides have to be prepared and published.
                          8. The    research      leaders    have    to    supervise    and    manage    the
                             funds allocated for their approved research proposal.
                          9. The  procurement  of  supplies,  materials  and  equipment  shall
                             be coordinated  with  the  Property  Custodian  and  Supply  Officer
                             of  the
                             center.
                          10.Full    time    faculty    researchers    should    hold    office    in    the
                             ResearchCenter.       In   cases,    where     the   faculty    researchers
                             have  teaching    load,    they    may    stay    in    their    mother    units,
                             provided    that  their     activities    as    researchers       are    duly
                             coordinated   with   the research monitoring and evaluation unit.

                   III.  Mechanics of Implementation

                      1. The  workload  system  applies  to  all   faculty  members  who  are
                          involved in R & E activities either full-time or part-time.

                      2. For  purposes  of  workload  credit,  the  assigned  task  external  to
                          the university  shall  be  covered  by  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement
                          between  the    University    and    the    partner    Agency    or    a    Special
                          Order  from  the office of the University President.

                      3. A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R & E
                          to be classified full-time researcher/extensions.

                      4. A  full-time  faculty  member  shall  be  entitled  to  workload  credit  in  R
                          & E  only  if  he/she  has  satisfied  the  minimum  workload  of  18
                          credit units in teaching and R & E work.

                      5. A  program  leader  who  is  a  project  leader  and  a  study  leader  in
                          the same  program  shall  only  be  credited  once  whichever  has  the
                          higher credit units.

                      6. Overload  pay  shall  be  given  to  faculty  researchers  whose  total
                          credit units is beyond 25 units

                      7. Faculty      member      with    external     activity    to   R&E     and    has
                          received honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units

                      8. All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.

                      9. Credit  units  as  researcher/extensions  shall  only  be  claimed  for
                          the  period  specified  in  the  program/project  study  activity  as
                          approved.

                      10. Workload  accreditation  of  other  R&E  activities  not  covered  by
                            these  guidelines    shall    be    referred    to    the    Office    of    the    Vice
                            President  for Research  &  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the
                            approval  of  the President.

                      11. The  rate  of  overload  pay  or  honorarium  is  similar  to  those  on
                            full time     teaching.



                                                                                                       267]]></page><page Index="291"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                      12.  The  funds  for  the  overload  shall  come  from  the  R  &  E  allocation
                           or from other sources which the University deems appropriate.

                          Honorarium

                                 Honorarium       is    a    form    of    remuneration    granted    to
                          researchers  for    services    rendered    beyond    the    minimum/regular
                          workload.     It  is  a form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of
                          officials/employees  on special  assignment.            For  this  purpose,  a
                          special  assignment  is  an undertaking     by      an     individual     or
                          a     composite      group     of officials/employees,   which   is   beyond
                          their   regular   and   primary functions.

                          higher  but  in  no  case  shall he/she receive both (UPLB Research
                          Manual, 2002)

                          Monitoring and

                          evaluation Research

                          Projects


                                 The   research   projects   are   monitored   in   two   ways:   (1)
                          the financial and (2) the technical aspects.

                                 The    accounting     department      of   the   University    monitors
                          and  audits  the  financial  status  of  the  research  funds.  However,  the
                          Special  Budget    Officer    of    the    ResearchCenter    records    every
                          disbursement  for each   research   project/unit   and   annotates   the
                          Purchase      Request  Forms    to    indicate    availability    of    funds    and
                          from  which  funds  the purchases are to be credited.

                                 The    Office    of    the    Director    of    Research    serves    as    the
                          monitoring  and    coordinating    arm    for    all    researches    in    the
                          University.       Although  research       activities    are    independently
                          undertaken   by   the   different colleges,   faculty   researchers   are   still
                          required   to   submit   quarterly progress  reports  on  their  research
                          projects/studies.   The  researchers submit  their  progress  reports  to
                          their  respective  Deans  concerned, which   in   turn   endorses   the
                          progress   reports   to   the   Office   of   the Director.  This  enables  the
                          ResearchCenter  to  keep  track  of  ongoing projects    for    monitoring
                          and    evaluation    as    well    as    workload compensation purposes.

                             The  technical  reports  are  submitted  by  the  project  proponent  to
                          the  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit  of  the  ResearchCenter.             The
                          numbers of copies are stated below:

                                Copies of Progress Report to be forwarded to the funding agency
                                Copies  of  the  Annual  Report  to  be  used  in  annual  agency
                                 in- house review
                                Copies of the Terminal Report to be submitted two months after
                                 the termination or completion of the project.

                   also  identifies  gaps  in  existing  knowledge,  helps  determine  whether  the
                   proposed study  is  in  the  proper  direction  or  not  and  eliminates  the
                   possibility  of duplication.

                   F. BUDGETARY REQUIREMENTS

                   The budget requirements include the following:

                   Personal  Services  (PS)  – total  requirement  for  wages,  honoraria,
                   additional hire and other personal benefits

                   Maintenance    and    Other    Operating    Expenses    (MOOE)    –    total
                   requirements  for        supplies      and       materials,      travel     expenses,
                   communication   and   other services.

                   Capital  Outlay  (CO)  – total  requirement  for  facilities  and  equipment
                   needed by the project.

                   G. WORKPLAN

                          A   tabular   matching   of   objectives   per  study,   expected   outputs
                   per objective,  and  activities  per  output  organized  in  Gantt  Chart.   Each
                   activity  for  an  expected  output  is  viewed  against  time  for  its  conduct  and
                   completion (see attached form).

                   H. LITERATURE CITED

                          This  includes  the  list  of  papers  cited  in  the  proposal  to  serve

                   RATIONALE:

                   Research  is  one  of    the  functions  of  the  university  and  all  colleges,
                   including  those  of  the  campuses  are  expected  to  be  involved  in  its
                   conduct.

                   The  AACCUP  guidelines  in  accrediting  academic  programs  of  colleges
                   and universities     also   look   at   the    kind    of   research    outputs     the
                   colleges   are producing during the time of evaluation.

                   Faculty    members   who    serve    as    thesis    advisers    have    no    continuing
                   research project(s)  in  spite  their  potential  in  proposing  and  implementing
                   researches along their fields of specialization and experiences.

                   Thesis  in  the  graduate  and  undergraduate  levels  as  well  as  in  the
                   laboratory school  are  expensive  and  need  some  forms  of  financial  support
                   in  pursuing student’s researches with improved quality of output.

                   Faculty   research   project   may   also   accommodate   and   fund   thesis
                   of students.

                   Students and faculty members need to expose and be more confident and
                   in coming up with quality of outputs.

                   There    is    need    for    the    colleges    to    identify    workable    and    doable
                   research  thrust,    agenda    and    program     that    will    serve    as    guide    in

                   Mechanics of Implementation:

                   Agenda/Program/Project/Study Setting and Prioritization

                   The    college/campus    shall    prepare    a    research    agenda/program
                   that corresponds  to  their  academic  offerings.   The  R&D  Agenda/Program
                   should be  prepared  by  assessing  the  current  problems  and  issues  of  the
                   industry.  The        R&D        Agenda/Program           of     each       of      the
                   colleges/campuses   shall   be reviewed   and   evaluated   by   the   Research
                   Council     for    approval   of   the Administrative  Council and the Board of
                   Regents.

                   All     approved     R&D     Agenda/Program     will     be     consolidated     by
                   the ResearchCenter   and   shall   become   the   University’s   R&D   Agenda
                   and Program.

                   In  the absence  of a more  comprehensive  research  agenda/program  for
                   each  of    the    different    colleges/campuses,    the    university    recommends
                   those  that are presented in Annex “A”.

                   a component of a long-term project.

                   Only    student    thesis    conducted    in    conformity    with    the    approved
                   research thrust/agenda   of   the   university   shall   qualify   for   assistance
                   under   this program.

                   The   faculty   researchers   who   will   be   designated   as   project   leaders
                   shall  prepare    a    research    project    proposal    by    following    the    format
                   prescribed  by the  university  (Annex  “B”).  For  student  thesis,  an  outline
                   shall  be  prepared by  the  student  by  following  the  prescribed  style  and
                   format  for  the  College and/or the University.

                   Screening and Evaluation of the Research Proposal

                   The    proposal    prepared    by    the    faculty    members    shall    be    initially
                   reviewed  and      evaluated     by    the    College/Campus        Research      Team
                   (activity   flow   in Annex “C”).

                   For  student  thesis,  an  outline  shall  be  reviewed  and  evaluated  during

                   University Board of Regents.

                   Budget Allocation

                   Every  year,  the  university  shall  allocate  funds  (1  to  3  million  pesos)  to
                   fund research   priorities   of   the   colleges   in   the   main   campus.      The
                   branch campuses,  through  their  Deans  shall  also  allocate  funds  for  their
                   identified priority R & D agenda/program.

                   Funding    shall    be    allocated    in    accordance    with    the    number    of
                   approved programs/projects/studies   for   each   of   the   disciplines,   e.g.
                   Agriculture; Engineering;     Education;     Economics,     Management     and
                   Development  Studies;  Physical  and  Health  Services,  etc.             The  college

                               PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES
                                               OF CAVITESTATEUNIVERSITY

                   I. Rationale

                          Republic    Act    No.    8293,    otherwise    known    as    the    Intellectual
                   Property Code of the Philippines, states that:

                          “The     State    recognizes      that    an    effective    intellectual    and
                   industrial  property  system  is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and
                   creative  activity,  facilitates  transfers  of  technology,  attracts  foreign
                   investments,  and  ensures  market    access    for    our    products.        It    shall
                   protect  and  secure  the  exclusive rights   of   scientist,   inventors,   artists
                   and   other   gifted   citizens   to   their intellectual   property   and   creations,
                   particularly   when   beneficial   to   the people.”

                          With    the    various    intellectual    properties    (IP’s)    developed    in
                   the university  such  as  the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,
                   design  for    biogas    digester    and    innumerable    research    outputs    being
                   presented  for public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire
                   protection.  The biogas    digester    was    just    recently    granted    a    patent,
                   while    research outputs/publications          have    been    presented     without
                   copyright   protection, except   for   some   that   were   able   to   acquire   ISBN
                   registration   from   the National   Library.   Therefore,   the   University   must
                   develop      a     system       for  protecting  economically  viable  intellectual
                   properties  to  maximize  gains  that  could  finance  more  researches  in  the
                   future.

                   II. Definition of Terms

                          “Copyright” is   the   protection   extended   to   expressions   and   not
                   to  ideas,    procedures,    and    methods    of    operations    or    mathematical
                   concepts  as such.  Such  expressions  may  be  in  the  forms  of  literary,
                   scholarly,  scientific and artistic works.

                          “Intellectual    Property    or    IP”    is    an    asset    that    possesses
                   commercial value   which   can   be   exploited   to   generate   revenue.   IP
                   value   lies   in   its utilization, not existence.

                          “Intellectual  Property  Rights”  or  “IPR”  refers  to  the  entitlement
                   and  enjoyment    of    the    attributes    of    ownership    over    intellectual
                   properties.    IPR  consists    of:    a)    Copyright    and    related    rights;    b)
                   Trademarks    and    Service  Marks;         c)    Geographic       Indications;      d)
                   Industrial     Designs;     e)    Patents;    f)  Layout-Designs    (Topographies)    of
                   Integrated  Circuits;  and  g)  Protection  of





                                                                                                       324]]></page><page Index="348"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS
                                                                                                        325

                   Undisclosed   Information.   1     IPR   shall   likewise   include   plant   varieties
                   and animal breeds.

                          “Patent’       is  a  grant  issued  by  the  Philippine  government  giving
                   an  inventor     the    right    to    exclude    others    from    making,      using,
                   setting,    or  importing  the  product  of  his  invention  within  the  Philippines
                   in exchange of his patentable information or disclosure.

                          “Patentable inventions”  means  any  technical  solution  of  a  problem
                   in any  field  of  human  activity  which  is  new,  involves  an  inventive  step
                   and  is industrially   applicable,   which   may   be,   or   may   related   to   a
                   product,   or process, or an improvement of any of the foregoing.        2

                          “Plant  variety”         means    a    plant    grouping    within    a    single
                   botanical taxon  of  the  lowest  known  rank  which  can  be  defined  by  the
                   expression  of the   characteristics   resulting   from   a   given   genotype,   or
                   combination   of genotypes,  distinguished  from  any  other  plant  groupings
                   by  the  expression of  at  least  one  characteristic  and  considered  as  a
                   unit    with    regard    to    the  suitability  for  being  propagated  unchanged.  A
                   variety may be represented by seed, transplants, plants, tubers, and tissue
                   culture plantlets.

                          “Prior art”    Everything  made  available  to  the  public  by  means  of
                   a written or  oral  disclosure,  by  use,  or  in  any  other  way, before  the  filing
                   date or   the   priority   date   of   the   application   claiming   the   invention.
                   Prior use which  is  not  present  in  the  Philippines,  even  if  widespread
                   in  a  foreign country,  cannot  form  part  of  the  prior  art  if  such  prior  use
                   is  not  disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.

                   III. Objective

                          To  establish  a  system  protecting  the  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)
                   or  results/products  generated  through  researches  conducted  in  the
                   university.

                   IV. Strategy

                          The  University  shall  establish  an  IPR  Office  that  covers    all
                   intellectual  property  protection  activities  and  provide  trainings/seminars
                   to researchers to  increase  awareness  on  IPR.  The  IPR  Office  will  be
                   divided    in    to    two  sections,    each    having    IPR    Assistants,    one    for
                   patentable  IP’s  and  the  other for publishable IP’s.

                          The  IPR  Officer  will  work  under  the  Office  of  the  Vice-President  for
                   Research,  Extension,                       Education  and  Training
                                 Continuing                                   Services

                   The IPR Officer will   be   required   to   work   in   close   coordination   with
                   both    research    and academic units of the university to identify research
                   results and intellectual property    rights    with    commercial    potential.    In
                   this    capacity    the    IPR Assistants will be responsible for applying for and
                   liquidating cash advances accrued  during  the  applications  and  payment
                   of  other  fees  pertinent  to  the application.  Where  necessary  the  IPR  Officer
                   will  work  with  the  University’s legal advisers.

                          The    IPR    Officer    and    IPR    Assistants    will    be    provided    with
                   appropriate external training to ensure that they can become competent in

                         T3 Faculty Capability Building Seminar for Research Documentation
                            March 28-29, 2019, International House 1, CvSU-Main Campus


               Organizers:  T3  Tanza,  Trece  Martires  City,  and  General  Trias  City  Campuses  Research
               Unit, T3 Faculty and University Research Center

               Participants: T3 Permanent, Temporary, Contractual, and selected J.O. Faculty Members

               Rationale:  The  T3  Campuses  have  envisioned  to  establish  a  culture  where  faculty  and
               students  shall  engage  in  research.  Hence,  the  faculty  members,  especially  those  with
               plantilla  positions  and  in  professional  rank,  are  encouraged  to  produce  an  approved  and
               funded   research   in   line   with   the   University’s   Research   Thrust.   Each   faculty   member
               recognizes the importance of  this endeavor as part  of  their  core functions as academician.
               However, the number of funded research is still very low at present for the three campuses
               maybe  because  there  is  a  need  for  knowledge  enhancement  of  the  protocols  in  writing  a
               research proposal and that makes this activity relevant. This capacity building activity would
               serve  as  a  stepping  stone  for  the  faculty  members  to  be  able  to  write  a  quality  research
               work. The activity further aims to increase the number of funded researches in the campus
               as well as the number of research publications.

               Objectives: This faculty research writing seminar-workshop aims to:
               1. Delineate the standards and concepts in  writing  a research  proposal with possibility for
                   funding by the University or through external funding sources; and
               2. Apply the concepts learned to produce quality and relevant research proposal at the end
                   of the seminar.


























                                Tanza faculty Mr. Mark Joel C. Sibulo helps out during the
                                registration.

               General  Trias  City,  and  Tanza  Campuses)  attended  the  seminar  entitled,  ―T3  Faculty
               Capacity  Building  Seminar  for  Research‖  at  International  House  1,  CvSU-Main  Campus,
               Indang,  Cavite  from  8:00  a.m.  to  5:00  p.m.,  with  Ms.  Leslie  Anne  N.  Gatdula,  CvSU-
               General Trias City Instructor, as in-charge of the ceremonies.

               Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,  gave  the  welcome  message,  which
               emphasized   the   importance   of   research   in   teaching,   saying   that   most   educators   are
               accustomed   to   using   materials   culled   from   other   countries   when   one   of   the   major
               components of life in the academe is innovation through research. He said that this was how
               teachers should  be teaching their corresponding subject matters. He  also mentioned that it
               took years for him to finally find his own niche in his field.

               importance of research to the University and its faculty members. She emphasized how hard
               work plays an important role in one’s commitment to research and that workload should not
               be a hindrance. She further mentioned that by the year 2025, innovation would be the main
               focus of the University. The importance of research was personal satisfaction, points in the
               NBC   evaluation,   additional   income,   networking   and   collaboration,   and   travel.   She
               encouraged  interdisciplinary  research.  She  also  tackled  the  different  thematic  areas  of  the
               research  and  extension  agenda  of  CvSU:  agri-fisheries  and  food  security,  biodiversity  and
               environmental  conservation,  smart  engineering,  ICT  and  industrial  competitiveness,  public
               health and welfare, and societal development and equality. She also talked about the official
               research   proposal  format   of   the   university,   which   consists   of   the  following:   overview,
               problem,  importance,  literature,  objectives,  and time and place.  Finally,  she tackled how to
               write  quality  research  proposals  for  possible  funding,  as  well  as  crafting  a  convincing
               introduction  that  includes  the  rationale  and  objectives.  She  credited  Dr.  Bautista’s  book  on
               technical writing for the contents of  her lecture on the principles of  writing a good research
               proposal and concluded her talk by emphasizing that researchers need to cherish their work
               and that there was no actual recipe for success but just ―simple rules, dedication, and hard
               work.‖

               For  the  second  speaker,  Dr.  Isaias  A.  Banaag,  Faculty  Researcher  of  the  College  of
               Education  (CED)  gave  his  talk  on  how  to  create  a  viable  theoretical  and  conceptual
               framework  for  research.  He  talked  about  the  common  error  regarding  the  Input-Process-
               Output  (IPO),  which  was  in  fact,  a  model  or  framework  and  not  a  method.  He  further  said
               that the framework was actually different from the research paradigm, a source of difficulty in
               most  research  papers.  The  problem,  he  said,  was  actually  rooted  in  problem  building,  the
               problem being the driving force behind a research, which should be geared to address gaps
               between  what  was  happening  and  what  should  be  happening.  Structure  or  maps  were
               needed in order to come up with broad areas to be covered in the research. This would help
               the researcher to emerge from chaotic thinking and into a more logical, organized viewpoint
               for  the  research  problem  at  hand.  He  also  explained  the  difference  between  a  theoretical
               framework and a conceptual framework: a theoretical framework is used when there is only
               one  theory  featured  in  a  basic  research,  whereas  a  conceptual  framework  is  used  when
               there are multiple theories and other personal observations that need to be synthesized in a
               more  complex  type  of  research.  He  also  distinguished  a  construct  from  a  variable—the
               construct being a concept with a deliberate and invented meaning, while a variable being a
               construct  with  an  assigned  numerical  value.  He  ended  his  discussion  by  summarizing  the
               differences  between  a  theoretical  framework  and  a  conceptual  framework:  a  theoretical
               framework is ―adopted from a pre-existing theory or theoretical perspective, an application of
               a  theory  as  a  whole  or  in  part,  and  with  a  literature  research  that  is  deductive‖  while  a
               conceptual framework is ―created from a variety of conceptual and theoretical perspective, a
               synthesis of relevant concepts, and with research literature that is usually inductive.‖

               and  Sciences,  discussed  how to  write  the  review of  related  literature  and  the  methodology
               portion of a research proposal. He talked about the most common sources available for use
               in a researcher’s review of related literature. He emphasized the importance of reading and
               mobility, spending time going over various references and going to different places in order
               to  find  relevant  material  for  one’s  research.  He  said  that  the  best  materials  were  those
               articles published within the last five years, on a case-to-case basis, depending on the field.
               Non-referred (i.e., not peer-reviewed) journals, newsletters, and magazines were considered
               unreliable  sources  of  literature.  He  stated  the  most  common  problem  in  research  was  the
               lack  of  available  literature.  When  literature  as  limited,  he  said,  a  researcher  may  conduct
               field work  or interviews  to determine whether  the topic was  worth pursuing;  if  not,  then the
               researcher should consider changing the topic. He also highlighted several key points such
               as always thinking of what one’s research will contribute to the field and avoiding duplication
               in order ―locate one’s research within the context of existing literature.‖ He further said that a
               literature  review  could  be  arranged  either  chronologically  or  thematically,  and  that  citation
               provide evidence of the researcher’s interpretation of the sources gathered. Being selective
               was very important, in that the researcher must choose only the most important points to be
               included   in   the   review.   One   must   also   exercise   caution   when   paraphrasing   to   avoid
               plagiarism.  It  was  also  important  to  keep  one’s  ―voice‖  and  restrain  oneself  from  being  a
               collection of different authors’ voices despite the fact that review must definitely include the
               ―big  names‖  or  experts  on  the  field.  The  review  must  be  punctuated  with  one’s  own
               perspective and interpretation of the new knowledge presented. He also discussed common
               mistakes  such  as  not  relating  clearly  to  the  research  problem,  not  taking  sufficient  time  to
               identify the most relevant sources to use, not relying on primary research studies, and only
               including sources that validate one’s assumptions rather than those that refute them.

               For the fourth speaker, Dr.  Agnes C. Francisco, another faculty researcher of the College
               of Arts and Sciences, talked about methods and methodology in the field of social sciences.
               She   first   distinguished   a   ―method,‖  a   technical   step   taken   to   do   research,   from   the
               ―methodology,‖ a  discussion  of  the  underlying  reason  why particular  methods  will  be  used.
               She said that the methodology portion of the research will answer questions on how the data
               will be collected or generated and then analyzed, and clearly articulates the reasons why a
               researcher  has  chosen  a  particular  procedure  or  technique.  She  further  stated  that  this
               section specifically features how the data gathered must  be treated in order to achieve the
               objectives of the research. It also discusses problems that are anticipated and how they can
               be  minimized  through  the  chosen  methods.  For  her,  this  was  very  important  because  the
               method  a  researcher  chooses  affects  the  results;  thus,  ―an  unreliable  method  produces
               unreliable  results.‖ A  faulty  methodology  brings  about  a  ―domino  effect,‖ affecting  all  other
               aspects  of  the  research  and  lessening  the  value  of  one’s  findings.  She  mentioned  the
               important sections of the methodology section: the research design (whether quantitative or
               qualitative, including the specific type or types to be used), the sampling technique (how the
               data     will     be     collected     and     what     safeguard     techniques     will     be     used),     the
               respondents/participants  or  source/corpus  for  those  studies  involving  discourse  (who  will
               participate  and  how  many)  the  research  instrument,  the  unit  of  analysis  (for  coding  in




                                                                                             V01-2018-07-17]]></page><page Index="579"><![CDATA[discourse), the data gathering procedure, and the data analysis portion. She emphasized the
               importance   of   anonymity   in   this   section,   especially   for   respondents   who   have   been
               interviewed,   and   other   agencies   involved   in   the   data-gathering   portion.   She   further
               recommended that 30% of the existing population was enough for a qualitative research and
               8-10 respondents for a qualitative one in order to ensure that the chosen sample was a good
               representative of the population, with the inclusion of corresponding profiles and justification
               for being selected. She reminded everyone about the importance of pre-testing for self-made
               instruments and to make sure that the tool specifically addressed the objectives and problem
               of  the  research.  Other  reminders  were  regarding  the  use  of  free-prior  informed  consent
               (FPIC)   or   waivers   for   sensitive   topics   with   ethical   issues   involved   and   avoiding   the
               unnecessary inclusion of definitions. Overall, she recommended the following components of
               an effectively written methodology section:  an clear methodological approach, a justification
               for how the chosen approach fits the research design, the specific methods to be used, the
               manner  in  which  the  data  will  be  analyzed,  a  solid  rationale  for  the  methodologies  to  be
               used,  a  well-supported  reason  for  the  choice  of  respondents,  and  a  comprehensive  yet
               concise scope and limitations section.

               For  the  fourth  speaker,  Dr.  Agnes  B.  Alimboyuguen,  another  faculty  researcher  of  the
               College of Arts and Sciences, talked about methods and methodology in the field of natural
               sciences. For this area, it describes the activities necessary for the completion of a project,
               mainly because it provides information that allows the reader to validate the results and the
               conclusion. She said that  some key requirements  of  a good natural science research were
               the  following:  understandable  and  repeatable,  conforms  to  objectives,  and  confined  to  the
               procedures  and  methods.  She  said  that  there  were  specific  details  to  be  included  such  as
               the manufacturer or model of the specialized equipment to be used, the sample to be used,
               time  and  place,  replications,  and  conditions  of  the  experiment,  data  analysis,  statistical
               analysis.   She   concluded   her   talk   by   emphasizing   that   research   impact,   academic
               consequences,  and  societal  consequences  were  three  major  considerations  in  research  in
               the natural sciences. The value of one’s research in terms of its long-term benefits was what
               counts. The beneficiaries should be the students, faculty and staff, farmers, government and
               private  institutions,  industry  and  other  clientele  outside  the  CvSU  community.  Publishable
               and patentable work was what they were looking for in this field. Impact assessment was no
               longer  the  measure  of  success  in  research  but  whether  there  was  a  policy  that  was
               developed out of the research. She encouraged everyone to copyright their works. Towards
               the end of her discussion, it was established, through the moderatorship of Prof. Sedigo, that
               the   T3   Campuses   will   focus   on   these   specific   programs:   Information   and   Computer
               Technology    (ICT),    Education,    Business    Management    (Entrepreneurship),    Hospitality
               Management (Product Development).

               Further discussions on the following topics ensued throughout the faculty capability-building
               seminar:  the  budgetary  requirements  and  work  plan,  the  major  activities  and  expected
               output, and the potential impact and target beneficiaries of the given research.

               Ms.  Roncesvalle  J.  Caipang,  T3  Research  Coordinator  who  spearheaded  and  organized
               the  capability  building  seminar,  gave  her  closing  remarks  by  thanking  everyone  for  their
               attendance and for a very productive day. Afterwards, Prof. Sedigo announced that on April
               1-2,  he  will  be  evaluating  all  proposals  before  endorsing  them  to  the  Research  Center  on
               April 3, 2019, not later than 6:00 p.m. All research titles were then submitted by the faculty
               members who no doubt became inspired and motivated at the end of the two-day capability-
               building seminar.

               The 1 Cavite Arduino Technology Research Forum and Exhibit was held on April 22, 2019
               from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Santiago M. Rolle Hall, CvSU-Main Campus, Indang
               Cavite. The event was organized by the Office of the Vice-President for Research and
               Extension (OVPRE) and College of Engineering and Information Technology, with the help of
               a number of sponsors: American Spaces Philippines, Fablab Manila, Sparkfruit Electronics,
               LEENTECH Network Solutions, RoboRAVE Philippines, and LITL.

               The said activity’s aim was to expose students and teachers to an event where they could
               accomplish the following goals: exhibit and present their Arduino-based research, interact and
               collaborate with other Cavite schools as well as nearby cities and provinces, and update
               themselves on the current application of Arduino technology on instruction, research,
               enterprise, and information technology. The local research forum was conducted in
               preparation for a much bigger event in the near future: an international conference to be held
               at CvSU in 2020. The   said future project was meant to be accomplished in partnership with
               the American Center, Manila and American Spaces Philippines.

               The program began with a doxology led by Pamela Daphne R. Busog, CvSU-Trece Martires
               City Campus Extension Coordinator, followed by the singing of the Philippine National Anthem
               led by Steven G. Quisto, a BS Information Technology student. The opening remarks were
               given by T3 Campus Administrator, Prof. Noel A. Sedigo and the introduction of the CvSU
               Administration Council by Prof. Allan Robert C. Solis, Director of the Public Information and
               Community Relations Office. Messages to the seminar’s participants were given by the
               following guest speakers: Dr. David L. Cero, Dean of the College of Engineering and
               Information Technology, Dr. Camilo A. Polinga, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Ruel
               M. Mojica,  Vice President for Research and Extension, and the University’s very own
               president, Dr.
               Hernando D. Robles. The certificate for the keynote speaker was awarded by the
               University President himself, together with the T3 Campus Administrator, Prof. Sedigo.

               T3 MIS Officer Keno A. Villavicencio introduced the first keynote speaker, Richard F.

               good platform for students to showcase their talents and passion for robotics and the like,
               especially for the younger students—those in senior high school. Through the effort of Sir
               Keno, we became connected and had a MOA with local and international companies and the
               government that deals with Arduino technology.‖ The event was indeed a success as it
               established solidarity among students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of Arduino technology
               in the IT industry—a hopeful turnout at a time where young professionals are expected to
               become more competitive in the digital world.]]></page><page Index="584"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="585"/><page Index="586"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="587"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="588"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="589"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="590"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="591"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="592"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="593"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="594"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="595"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="596"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="597"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="598"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="599"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="600"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="601"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="602"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="603"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="604"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="605"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="606"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="607"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="608"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="609"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="610"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="611"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="612"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="613"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="614"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="615"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="616"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="617"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="618"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="619"><![CDATA[INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH VOLUME 9, ISSUE 04, APRIL      ISSN 2277-

        Abstract:  Coffee  farmers  or  growers  have  difficulty  in  classifying  nutritional  deficiencies  in  coffee  plants.  Proper  detection  of  these
        nutritional  deficiencies  could  help  them  in  giving  proper  intervention  to  plants.  The  study  was  conducted  to  classify  and  detect  the  nutritional
        deficiencies in coffee plants  using  image  processing  and  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN).  Once  the  nutritional  deficiency  is  identified,
        the  prototype  will  display recommended fertilizer for the plant. One thousand images with eight nutritional deficiencies were used in the study
        namely, Boron (B), Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc (Z). The study covered the
        four  varieties  of  coffee  named  Arabica,  Robusta,  Excelsa  and  Liberica  existing  in  the  Philippines.  The  capturing  of  images  for  testing  and
        training the dataset were  done in coffee farms and nurseries in Cavite State University, National Coffee Research, Development and Extension
        Center (NCRDEC) and Amadeo, Cavite. Experimental and development  research designs were  used.  Image  processing  techniques was  utilized
        in converting  the  images  into  grayscale  and  binary  values  for threshold  and  segmentation.  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  provides
        the  predicted  nutritional  deficiencies  in  the  coffee  plants  through classification and detection. Results shows that CNN has a high accuracy
        in  detecting  and  classifying  the  nutritional  deficiencies  in  coffee  plants.  The  prototype  was  evaluated,  and  results  shows  that  it  is  an  effective
        alternative for classifying and detecting the nutritional deficiencies in coffee plants.

              This  research  assessed  the  respondents‘  philosophies  in  teaching,  ideas  of
              educational assessment,         approaches       used     to    measure      their    students‘
              performances,   tools   in assessment they perceive to be effective and their views
                        st
              about 21 century assessment tools.  The  study  used  the  descriptive-correlative
              survey  to  explain  the  relationship between their personal philosophies and the

                 st
              21 century tools they used to assess their students. Majority of the respondents
              held  an  eclectic  view  of  teaching  and  look  up  to  alternative  concept  of
                                                                               st
              classroom management. Their viewpoint in using 21 century assessment tools
              contradict in terms of their perceptions on the best purpose and major emphasis
              of assessment, teacher‘s role in assessing students, and on what students must
              achieve  in  learning  and  the  teacher‘s  preferred  nature  of  test  plan.  While
              few respondents  favor  21 century  teaching  tools,  most  of  them  still  stick  to
                                              st
              using    the  traditional  style  of  assessment.  The  respondents‘  perspectives  in
              assessing  their  students  led  to  eclecticism  for  their  lack  of  consistency  and
              firmness in sticking to the particular use of modern assessment tools. This means
              they do  not have a single best preference of  assessment tools used in judging
              their students‘ performances.

              Most  teachers  assume that  asking questions  contributes  to  the  effectiveness of

              their  instruction.  Because  proper  questioning  techniques  are  important  in  the
              classroom,  this  study  identified  the  Mathematics  pre-service  teachers‘
              classification of test items using the  revised  Bloom‘s  Taxonomy  (rBT)  and  the
              Cunningham‘s  Levels  of  Questions (CLQs).  It used a group of forty two pre-
              service Mathematics teachers who were asked to classify each thinking skills in
              the rBT as to LOT or HOT and then create test items falling under each category
              of the rBT and CLQ.  Results revealed that most of the pre- service teachers have

              viewed LOT and HOT based on the level of difficulty of the given problem.  They
              found it relatively easier to create test items using the Cunningham‘s Levels of
              Questions, a non-familiar nomenclature for classifying test items, rather than the
              well-known  Bloom‘s  Taxonomy.                 Pre-service  teachers  should  be  able  to
              identify and classify questions according to their cognitive purposes.

              Microbial analysis has long been used as an indicator of water quality. Since the
              passing of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, microbial standards have been
              strictly  set  by  the  Philippine  National  Standards  for  Drinking  Water  2007  to

              ensure that the public health is protected  from bacterial pathogens. This study
              determined and compared the most  probable  number  (MPN)  of  heterotrophic
              and  coliform  bacteria  from  the  ice samples collected in Trece Martires City
              and Tanza public market. The PNSWD were used as a reference to analyze the
              samples.  The  two  ice  samples  from  Trece  Martires  City    and    Tanza             public

              market  in  Cavite  were  analysed  in  DOST  Water  Testing Laboratory in Trece
              Martires  City  using  presumptive,  confirmed,  and  completed  tests.  There  is  a
              high MPN of heterotrophic, coliform, and fecal coliform from ice collected from
              the two sampling sites. The heterotrophic, coliform and fecal coliform bacteria
              from  the  ice  collected  in  the  two  sampling  sites  were  higher  compared  to  the
              PNSWD standard.  The  bacteriological  quality  of  ice  did  not  meet  the  criteria
              guidelines    of  PNSWD  standards  in  terms  of  the  heterotrophic  and  coliform

              bacteria most probable counts.

              The researchers  used  the  input-process-output  (IPO)  mode  –  the  input
              consists  of  the information,  software,  and  hardware  required  for  the

              fulfillment  of  the  system;  the process  contains  the  system  design,
              development  and  testing;  and  the  output  is  the Geometor  mobile  application.

              The  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  customer  perception  towards
              male  and female salespersons‘ approach in selected appliance centers in Cavite.
              Specifically, the study  aims  to:  (1)  determine  the  demographic  profile  of  the
              customers  in  selected appliance centers in Cavite; (2) determine the perception

              of the customers on the sales approach  of  male  and  female  salesperson;  (3)
              determine  the  significant  difference between  male  and  female  salesperson
              approach  as  perceived  by  customers;  (4) determine whether the approach of
              male  and  female  salesperson  affects  the  purchase  decision  of  the  customers;
              and  (5)  determine  the  characteristic  of  the  salesperson  that  mostly  affect  the
              purchase  decision  of  the  customers.The  study  used  descriptive-cross  sectional
              design  to  determine  the  customer  perception  towards  male  and  female

              salespersons‘    approach    in    selected    appliance    centers    in    Cavite.    The
              researchers conveniently selected appliance centers in Cavite and selected 154
              participants  who  are  the  customers  of  selected  appliance  centers  using  quota
              sampling technique. As a result, majority of the participants belonged to the age
              bracket of 25-31 years old. The total frequency of female participants is 121 and

              33  for  male  participants.  Most  of  them  were  single  and  the  salesperson  that
              approaches the customers was saleslady. The perception of  the  customers  are
              strongly  agree  to  male  and  female  salesperson  instant  buddy approach;  agree
              to  male  and  female  salesperson  guru  approach;  agree  to  male  and female

              approach  and  disagree  for  male  approach;  and  disagree  to  male  and  female
              salesperson hard seller approach. Furthermore, there is no significant difference

              on male and female salesperson  instant  buddy,  guru,  networker  and  hard
              seller    approaches    except    to  salesperson  networker  approach  which  has
              significant difference.  Thus, the  male  and female  salesperson approaches does
              not  affect  the  purchase  decision  of  the  customers.  Also,  the  ego-drive
              salesperson characteristic mostly affects the purchase decision of the customers.

              behavior and the relationship between considerations on sanitary napkin product
              attributes  and  buying  behavior  of  industrial  estate  employees  in  Cavite.  The
              study  was  conducted  from  January  2017 to June 2018.  Descriptive    statistical
              method  such  as  frequency,  percentage  and  mean  was  used  to interpret
              characteristics,    considerations    on    sanitary    napkin    product    attributes    and
              buying  behavior.  To  determine  the  significance  between  variables,  the  t-test

              estates of Cavite are aged 18 to 25, single, high school graduates, earn below
              P10,000 and most use Modess. Sanitary  napkin  product  attributes  in  terms  of
              sensory,  image,  liking,  and  expected performance  were  considered.  Buying
              behavior    of    employees    in    terms    of    social,  physical  and  psychological
              behavior,  were  considered.  There  is  significant  relationship  between

              considerations  on  sanitary  napkin  product    attribute  and    buying  behavior  of
              industrial estate employees in Cavite.The researchers recommend producers of
              sanitary napkin to focus on physical attractiveness, being environmentally friendly
              and attributes that  makes  customer  feel  nice.  They  should  educate  consumers
              about    the    personal  values,  benefits  and  quality  of    a  product.  Researchers

              selected attractions. Thus, the researchers conducted a descriptive - correlational
              type  of  research.  Specifically,  this  study  aimed  to:  1.  identify  the  participants‘

              demographic profiles in terms of age; sex; marital status; educational attainment
              and  monthly  income;  2.  To  identify  the  services  offered  are  in  terms  of
              facilities;  and  customer  services;  3.  To  identify  the  levels  of  satisfaction  of
              tourists towards the selected Tagaytay City‘s attraction sites in terms of facilities;
              and  customer  services;  and  4.  To  know  the  relationship  between  services

              offered and tourists‘ satisfaction. A non-probability snowball sampling technique
              was used to gather data by conducting a survey exactly to a hundred tourists who
              have  gone  into  both  the  two  attraction  sites.  The  participants  were  mostly
              female  aged  24    –  29  years,  married,  high  school  graduates  and  is  earning
              between ₱11, 000 to ₱21, 000. Based  on  the  analyzed  results,  there  is  a

              study.  Moreover, this current research aimed  to  study  the  life  experiences  of

              have been staying in the center for the shortest  period  of time and diagnosed

              with Substance Abuse Disorder were observed within two months period of time
              provided  with pre-interview and  post  interview.   The results were thematically

               Two  trending  and  interesting  subjects-Adolescents  and  Facebook  are
               collaborated  to  form  a  seasonal  study.  A  quantitative-descriptive  correlational
               study was conducted with a principal aim which was to know if personality and
               self-concept  are  predictors  of  self-presentation.  Participants  were  adolescents

               aged  16-19  years  old  and  were  an  active  Facebook  users  from  the  selected
               Cavite State University (CvSU) campuses in Bacoor, Imus, Cavite City, General
               Trias  and  Trece  Martires.  Purposive  Sampling  was  used  in  choosing  and
               gathering participants. To start with, researchers identify first the demographic
               profile   of    the   participants    including    the    number      of    their  friends    in

               Facebook and their usage of the said application. Personality, self-concept and
               self- presentation of the participants were determined, too. Adolescents (N=77)
               participated  and  answered  the  following  questionnaires:  Big  Five  Inventory
               (BFI),  Self-Concept  Clarity    Scale    and           Self-Presentation    on    Facebook
               Questionnaire.        All    data    were  gathered,  computed  and  analyzed,  through
               Pearson – r results show that personality is not  related  to  self-presentation  (co-
               efficient    0.166,    P-Value    0.149).    However,    self-  concept    has    significant

               relationship  with  self-presentation  (co-efficient  -0.234,  P- Value 0.041). The
               way adolescents perceived themselves affect the way they present online. It is
               recommended  to  give  more  in-depth  analysis,  time  and  attention  in  using
               personality  as  variable.  Moreover,  its  sub  scales  could  be  used  individually
               as  a variable  like  what  most  of  the  previous  studies  did  where  they  got
               more    justified  results.  Having  considered  all  gathered  data  and  results,

               researchers  have  been  able  to  give  recommendation  to  the  adolescents
               themselves,  to  the  parents,  to  the  university  itself  including  all  other  schools,
               and  to  the  future  researchers.  Adolescents  should  read  articles,  journals  and
               researches  especially  those  that  talked  about  them  so  that  they  could    gain
               knowledge  and  awareness  in  the  midst  of  identity  searching  and  role
               confusion. Parents should also be aware of self-presentation among adolescents
               online  even  offline.  They  are  the  most  responsible  in  this  stage  of  their

               child/children. As said to  be       the  second  parents,  schools         and  universities
               should    conduct    seminars        and  colloquiums  that  open  doors  for  different
               researches and give information of awareness which benefit the students. Future
               researchers  could  conduct  another  study  related  to  this  with  other  variables

              Abuse  occurs  when  people  did  not  treat  others  correctly  (Patricelli,  2017).
              There are different types of abuses, but in this study, physical and verbal abuses

              are the focus. The purpose of the study is to determine the psychological well-
              being of young adults, their reason  why  they  stay  in  relationship  despite  the
              physical  and  verbal  abuses  they experienced, and to identify their future plans
              and solutions. The research design that the  researchers  used  was  Narrative
              Qualitative  Research.  Eight  (8)  responded  were selected through purposive

              sampling. A validated self-made interview guide was used to gather data. Based
              on the results, there are two (2) categories for psychological well- being: positive
              and  negative.  Results  also  show  that  respondents  experienced  physical  abuse
              more than verbal abuse. Researchers found that love, happiness and family were
              the  reasons  why  they  stay  in  relationship  and  does  not  have  a  will  to  end
              their relationship. Moreover, results shows that young adults leave their partner
              temporarily, protect their selves during abuse, and confront their partner to cope

              with the situation. The plans and solutions of the respondents, based on the result,
              are to attend counseling sessions, to compromise, to confront, and to endure. The
              respondents have strong belief and faith that their abusive partner will change in
              the  future.  Researchers  recommend  that    respondents    undergo    counseling
              sessions  with  their  abusive  partner  to  discuss issues and to provide solutions

              on ways to more communicate effectively to dissolve the conflict and eliminate
              physical and verbal abuse.

              frequency and  carbon  loading capacity  of  mangrove species  in barangay Sta.
              Ana, and Tanagan, Calatagan, Batangas. Epidermal cell and  stomata from the
              leaf  samples  of  different  mangrove  species  were  counted  and  stomatal

              frequency was computed following the Salisbury formula. DBH, height and the
              biomass  were  measured  to  determine  the  carbon  loading  capacity  of  each
              mangrove  species  in  both  sampling  sites.  There  were  four  mangrove  species
              identified  in barangay  Sta.  Ana  namely,  Rhizophora  apiculata, Sonneracia
              alba,  Avicennia  marina,  and  Lumnitzera  racemosa,  while  all  three  except  L.
              racemosa were  found  in  barangay  Tanagan,  Calatagan,  Batangas.  A.  marina

              has  the  highest stomatal frequency (sf) of 43.37% and R. apiculata has the least
              SF  of  36.73%  among  the  four  species.    For  the  carbon  loading  capacity  of
              mangrove  species,  S.  alba    has  accounted  carbon  loading  capacity  of
              1,105,759.721g/cm for 127 individuals in brgy. Sta. Ana and 17,544,871.4g/cm
              for 28 individuals in brgy. Tanagan which appears to be the highest among all
              mangroves surveyed. L. racemosa had the least total CLC of 12,840.6915g/cm
              for  5  individuals  in brgy.  Sta  Ana.  A.  marina  on  the other  hand obtained the

              least  CLC  of  6,618,908.909g/cm  for  11  individuals  in  brgy.  Tanagan.  As  to
              relationship  of  stomatal        frequency  and  carbon  loading   capacity,  result
              shows negative   correlation   (-0.03)   between   the   carbon   loading   capacity
              and      stomatal  frequency  indicating  that  the  number  of    stomata  had  no
              relationship as to the amount of  carbon  a  mangrove  species  can  sequester.

              Instead,  the  amount  of  carbon  load  is dependent on the age or how long a tree
              existed on a particular ecosystem. The older the  tree,  the  greater   the   amount
              of   carbon  storage.  However,  similar   study  is recommended to be conducted
              correlating the same species with same age structure to support current findings
              on the relationship of stomata to carbon loading capacity of mangrove species.

               select    the    participants.    Criteria    and  qualification    were    set.    Participants
               should  be a  graduate of  Bachelor of  Science in Industrial Education (BSIE)
               with their respective specialization and currently teaching in  elementary  level,

               regardless  of  sex,  age,  years  of  teaching,  public  or  private institutions as
               long as willing to participate in the study. Adapted demographic profile survey
               form and self-made interview questionnaire, which underwent validation, were
               used  to  answer the  research objectives.   Results reveal  that  handling the
               pupils  and  teaching    the    subject    matter    that    is    mismatched    from    their

               expertise    are    the    main  struggles  teachers‘  encountered.  Moreover,
               opportunities such as learning and gaining new  expertise  in  teaching  is  one  of
               the  opportunities  experienced  by  most  of  the teachers              and  they  adjusted
               through    their   passion,    coping    and    loving    their    work.  Therefore,    it    is
               recommended  to  hire  and  select  qualified  and  appropriate  teaching personnel
               to  teach  elementary  pupils.  Also,  teachers  who  are  involved  in  specialization

        Abstract:  Coffee  farmers  or  growers  have  difficulty  in  classifying  nutritional  deficiencies  in  coffee  plants.  Proper  detection  of  these
        nutritional  deficiencies  could  help  them  in  giving  proper  intervention  to  plants.  The  study  was  conducted  to  classify  and  detect  the  nutritional
        deficiencies in coffee plants  using  image  processing  and  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN).  Once  the  nutritional  deficiency  is  identified,
        the  prototype  will  display recommended fertilizer for the plant. One thousand images with eight nutritional deficiencies were used in the study
        namely, Boron (B), Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc (Z). The study covered the
        four  varieties  of  coffee  named  Arabica,  Robusta,  Excelsa  and  Liberica  existing  in  the  Philippines.  The  capturing  of  images  for  testing  and
        training the dataset were  done in coffee farms and nurseries in Cavite State University, National Coffee Research, Development and Extension
        Center (NCRDEC) and Amadeo, Cavite. Experimental and development  research designs were  used.  Image  processing  techniques was  utilized
        in converting  the  images  into  grayscale  and  binary  values  for threshold  and  segmentation.  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  provides
        the  predicted  nutritional  deficiencies  in  the  coffee  plants  through classification and detection. Results shows that CNN has a high accuracy
        in  detecting  and  classifying  the  nutritional  deficiencies  in  coffee  plants.  The  prototype  was  evaluated,  and  results  shows  that  it  is  an  effective
        alternative for classifying and detecting the nutritional deficiencies in coffee plants.

        1 INTRODUCTION                                        Adequate    nutrients    are    essential  to    plants    for  growth.
        Coffee  is  known  as  the  most  important  crop  commodity  in   During  the  vegetation  to  pre-flowering  of  coffee  plants,
        the world  [1].  People  around  the  world  drink  two  billion    Nitrogen and Potassium  promote   the  growth   of  tissues
        cups  of coffee  every  day. A total  of  25  million  of  families    in   new  plants. Calcium is  for  leaf growth  that provides
        depend    for  coffee  for  living  specifically  for  business  or  as   high    yield    for  plants.  Magnesium  serve  as  fuel  for
        growers.  For  the  last    15    years,    43    percent    of    coffee    developing tissues and Sulfur to maximize the growth of the
        consumption  has  arisen worldwide [2]. The first coffee tree   plant  through  protein.  During  the  post    flowering    to    berry

        manifestation coffee trees in Batangas was  destroyed  and    nutrients  are  needed  by  the  plants  in  their  berry  expansion
        few of  surviving  trees  was  transferred  to Cavite.  As  of    and  berry  maturity  [9].  These  nutrients  are  in  need
        2019,  Batangas    produces    13    percent  of  the  coffee    necessary   for   the   growth    of  coffee    plants.   A    healthy
        supply    in    CALABARZON    (Region    IV-A)    and    Cavite   coffee  plants  could  maximize  the  number  of  yields  that
        produces  67  percent  [3].  The  climate  and  soil  condition  in   may  produce.    However,    identification    of    nutritional
