Modern Technology in communication no doubt has turned the entire world into a “Global             village”  (Asemah and Edegoh, 2012). ). Hence, this research was done to find out the social media,             learning  styles  and  academic  performance  among  the  students  of T3  campuses  of  Cavite  State              University,  namely, Trece Martires City, Tanza and General Trias in order to establish a basis for             enhancement  of     guidance  and  counseling  program..  The  descriptive-comparative  method  of             research  was  utilized  that  investigated  and  described  the  relationship  between  variables  in  their             natural setting without  manipulation.                     Results of the study showed that in general, majority of students used Facebook (81.7 %),             YouTube (50.7 %), and Google+ (26.0 %) while the use of Blogspot and Wordress or Joomla was              only  one. The mean and standard deviation of not using Google + (M=2.05, SD = 0.024) and using             Google+   (M=1.91, SD =0.039).The computed t-value was 3.056 with a p-value of 0.002 which is             significant at             0.05 level. This suggests that using Google+ as a social media platform has a significant effect on              the  academic performance of the student.                     The  findings  also  showed  the  significant  difference  of  Academic  Performance  of  the                    participants            and their Learning Styles using F-test, the computed value was 3.190 and with the p-value of 0.005,             significant at 0.05 level.

These  exams may  be administered at  any level  of  education,  from primary to  higher  education,                   although  they  are  more  common  at  higher  levels.  It  was  in  the  school  year  1997-1998  when  the  school                   decided to use the standardized test of the CEM. After a few administrations, it was found out that none  was                   able to pass the test or hardly reached an expected score. Due to fear that only a few will be qualified  to enroll                   in  college  which  may  lead  to  bankruptcy,  the  school  decided  to  stop  the  administration  of  the    said                   standardized test by the CEM and returned to using the teacher-made test.                    METHODS                   The  study  used  correlational  research  method.  The  method  was  used  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which                   variations in one factor such as the first year college academic performance correlate with variations in  one                   or more other factors such as college entrance exam results and high school scholastic records based  on the                   correlation  coefficient.  The  primary  data  were  obtained  through  the  entrance  exam  results,  high    school                   scholastic records, and college academic grades from the Office of the Campus Registrar.                    RESULTS                   College entrance exam results of students have fairly satisfactory results. Participant's high school  scholastic                   records and academic performance in college are satisfactory.  There is a significant difference  between the                   college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  in  students'  academic  performance  in                   college. The F-ratio of 46.36 is greater than the F critical value for .05 level of 3.01. The  computed F-ratio                   being  greater  than  the  tabulated  F-ratio  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.    Rejecting  the  null                   hypothesis further proves that college entrance exam results and high school scholastic  records are significant                   to student's academic performance in college.                    DISCUSSIONS                   The  college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  are  significant  to  student's  academic                   performance in college. According to the Campus Registrar, high school records could be a determinant  of                   college  entrance  exam  since  the  students  had  their  high  school  for  four  years  and  the  entrance  exam                   measures  their  gained  knowledge  from  their  previous  education.  It  may  also  the  reason  why  the  college                   entrance exam could also be a determinant of first-year college grades since they are in the adjustment  period                   from at least four years in high school.

Modern Technology in communication no doubt has turned the entire world into a “Global             village”  (Asemah and Edegoh, 2012). ). Hence, this research was done to find out the social media,             learning  styles  and  academic  performance  among  the  students  of T3  campuses  of  Cavite  State              University,  namely, Trece Martires City, Tanza and General Trias in order to establish a basis for             enhancement  of     guidance  and  counseling  program..  The  descriptive-comparative  method  of             research  was  utilized  that  investigated  and  described  the  relationship  between  variables  in  their             natural setting without  manipulation.                     Results of the study showed that in general, majority of students used Facebook (81.7 %),             YouTube (50.7 %), and Google+ (26.0 %) while the use of Blogspot and Wordress or Joomla was              only  one. The mean and standard deviation of not using Google + (M=2.05, SD = 0.024) and using             Google+   (M=1.91, SD =0.039).The computed t-value was 3.056 with a p-value of 0.002 which is             significant at             0.05 level. This suggests that using Google+ as a social media platform has a significant effect on              the  academic performance of the student.

These  exams may  be administered at  any level  of  education,  from primary to  higher  education,                   although  they  are  more  common  at  higher  levels.  It  was  in  the  school  year  1997-1998  when  the  school                   decided to use the standardized test of the CEM. After a few administrations, it was found out that none  was                   able to pass the test or hardly reached an expected score. Due to fear that only a few will be qualified  to enroll                   in  college  which  may  lead  to  bankruptcy,  the  school  decided  to  stop  the  administration  of  the    said                   standardized test by the CEM and returned to using the teacher-made test.                    METHODS                   The  study  used  correlational  research  method.  The  method  was  used  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which                   variations in one factor such as the first year college academic performance correlate with variations in  one                   or more other factors such as college entrance exam results and high school scholastic records based  on the                   correlation  coefficient.  The  primary  data  were  obtained  through  the  entrance  exam  results,  high    school                   scholastic records, and college academic grades from the Office of the Campus Registrar.                    RESULTS                   College entrance exam results of students have fairly satisfactory results. Participant's high school  scholastic                   records and academic performance in college are satisfactory.  There is a significant difference  between the                   college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  in  students'  academic  performance  in                   college. The F-ratio of 46.36 is greater than the F critical value for .05 level of 3.01. The  computed F-ratio                   being  greater  than  the  tabulated  F-ratio  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.    Rejecting  the  null                   hypothesis further proves that college entrance exam results and high school scholastic  records are significant                   to student's academic performance in college.                    DISCUSSIONS                   The  college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  are  significant  to  student's  academic                   performance in college. According to the Campus Registrar, high school records could be a determinant  of                   college  entrance  exam  since  the  students  had  their  high  school  for  four  years  and  the  entrance  exam                   measures  their  gained  knowledge  from  their  previous  education.  It  may  also  the  reason  why  the  college                   entrance exam could also be a determinant of first-year college grades since they are in the adjustment  period                   from at least four years in high school.

Modern Technology in communication no doubt has turned the entire world into a “Global             village”  (Asemah and Edegoh, 2012). ). Hence, this research was done to find out the social media,             learning  styles  and  academic  performance  among  the  students  of T3  campuses  of  Cavite  State              University,  namely, Trece Martires City, Tanza and General Trias in order to establish a basis for             enhancement  of     guidance  and  counseling  program..  The  descriptive-comparative  method  of             research  was  utilized  that  investigated  and  described  the  relationship  between  variables  in  their             natural setting without  manipulation.                     Results of the study showed that in general, majority of students used Facebook (81.7 %),             YouTube (50.7 %), and Google+ (26.0 %) while the use of Blogspot and Wordress or Joomla was              only  one. The mean and standard deviation of not using Google + (M=2.05, SD = 0.024) and using             Google+   (M=1.91, SD =0.039).The computed t-value was 3.056 with a p-value of 0.002 which is             significant at             0.05 level. This suggests that using Google+ as a social media platform has a significant effect on              the  academic performance of the student.                     The  findings  also  showed  the  significant  difference  of  Academic  Performance  of  the                    participants            and their Learning Styles using F-test, the computed value was 3.190 and with the p-value of 0.005,             significant at 0.05 level.

These  exams may  be administered at  any level  of  education,  from primary to  higher  education,                   although  they  are  more  common  at  higher  levels.  It  was  in  the  school  year  1997-1998  when  the  school                   decided to use the standardized test of the CEM. After a few administrations, it was found out that none  was                   able to pass the test or hardly reached an expected score. Due to fear that only a few will be qualified  to enroll                   in  college  which  may  lead  to  bankruptcy,  the  school  decided  to  stop  the  administration  of  the    said                   standardized test by the CEM and returned to using the teacher-made test.                    METHODS                   The  study  used  correlational  research  method.  The  method  was  used  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which                   variations in one factor such as the first year college academic performance correlate with variations in  one                   or more other factors such as college entrance exam results and high school scholastic records based  on the                   correlation  coefficient.  The  primary  data  were  obtained  through  the  entrance  exam  results,  high    school                   scholastic records, and college academic grades from the Office of the Campus Registrar.                    RESULTS                   College entrance exam results of students have fairly satisfactory results. Participant's high school  scholastic                   records and academic performance in college are satisfactory.  There is a significant difference  between the                   college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  in  students'  academic  performance  in                   college. The F-ratio of 46.36 is greater than the F critical value for .05 level of 3.01. The  computed F-ratio                   being  greater  than  the  tabulated  F-ratio  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.    Rejecting  the  null                   hypothesis further proves that college entrance exam results and high school scholastic  records are significant                   to student's academic performance in college.                    DISCUSSIONS                   The  college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  are  significant  to  student's  academic                   performance in college. According to the Campus Registrar, high school records could be a determinant  of                   college  entrance  exam  since  the  students  had  their  high  school  for  four  years  and  the  entrance  exam                   measures  their  gained  knowledge  from  their  previous  education.  It  may  also  the  reason  why  the  college                   entrance exam could also be a determinant of first-year college grades since they are in the adjustment  period                   from at least four years in high school.

Modern Technology in communication no doubt has turned the entire world into a “Global             village”  (Asemah and Edegoh, 2012). ). Hence, this research was done to find out the social media,             learning  styles  and  academic  performance  among  the  students  of T3  campuses  of  Cavite  State              University,  namely, Trece Martires City, Tanza and General Trias in order to establish a basis for             enhancement  of     guidance  and  counseling  program..  The  descriptive-comparative  method  of             research  was  utilized  that  investigated  and  described  the  relationship  between  variables  in  their             natural setting without  manipulation.                     Results of the study showed that in general, majority of students used Facebook (81.7 %),             YouTube (50.7 %), and Google+ (26.0 %) while the use of Blogspot and Wordress or Joomla was              only  one. The mean and standard deviation of not using Google + (M=2.05, SD = 0.024) and using             Google+   (M=1.91, SD =0.039).The computed t-value was 3.056 with a p-value of 0.002 which is             significant at             0.05 level. This suggests that using Google+ as a social media platform has a significant effect on              the  academic performance of the student.                     The  findings  also  showed  the  significant  difference  of  Academic  Performance  of  the                    participants            and their Learning Styles using F-test, the computed value was 3.190 and with the p-value of 0.005,             significant at 0.05 level.

These  exams may  be administered at  any level  of  education,  from primary to  higher  education,                   although  they  are  more  common  at  higher  levels.  It  was  in  the  school  year  1997-1998  when  the  school                   decided to use the standardized test of the CEM. After a few administrations, it was found out that none  was                   able to pass the test or hardly reached an expected score. Due to fear that only a few will be qualified  to enroll                   in  college  which  may  lead  to  bankruptcy,  the  school  decided  to  stop  the  administration  of  the    said                   standardized test by the CEM and returned to using the teacher-made test.                    METHODS                   The  study  used  correlational  research  method.  The  method  was  used  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which                   variations in one factor such as the first year college academic performance correlate with variations in  one                   or more other factors such as college entrance exam results and high school scholastic records based  on the                   correlation  coefficient.  The  primary  data  were  obtained  through  the  entrance  exam  results,  high    school                   scholastic records, and college academic grades from the Office of the Campus Registrar.                    RESULTS                   College entrance exam results of students have fairly satisfactory results. Participant's high school  scholastic                   records and academic performance in college are satisfactory.  There is a significant difference  between the                   college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  in  students'  academic  performance  in                   college. The F-ratio of 46.36 is greater than the F critical value for .05 level of 3.01. The  computed F-ratio                   being  greater  than  the  tabulated  F-ratio  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.    Rejecting  the  null                   hypothesis further proves that college entrance exam results and high school scholastic  records are significant                   to student's academic performance in college.                    DISCUSSIONS                   The  college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  are  significant  to  student's  academic                   performance in college. According to the Campus Registrar, high school records could be a determinant  of                   college  entrance  exam  since  the  students  had  their  high  school  for  four  years  and  the  entrance  exam                   measures  their  gained  knowledge  from  their  previous  education.  It  may  also  the  reason  why  the  college                   entrance exam could also be a determinant of first-year college grades since they are in the adjustment  period                   from at least four years in high school.

Modern Technology in communication no doubt has turned the entire world into a “Global             village”  (Asemah and Edegoh, 2012). ). Hence, this research was done to find out the social media,             learning  styles  and  academic  performance  among  the  students  of T3  campuses  of  Cavite  State              University,  namely, Trece Martires City, Tanza and General Trias in order to establish a basis for             enhancement  of     guidance  and  counseling  program..  The  descriptive-comparative  method  of             research  was  utilized  that  investigated  and  described  the  relationship  between  variables  in  their             natural setting without  manipulation.                     Results of the study showed that in general, majority of students used Facebook (81.7 %),             YouTube (50.7 %), and Google+ (26.0 %) while the use of Blogspot and Wordress or Joomla was              only  one. The mean and standard deviation of not using Google + (M=2.05, SD = 0.024) and using             Google+   (M=1.91, SD =0.039).The computed t-value was 3.056 with a p-value of 0.002 which is             significant at             0.05 level. This suggests that using Google+ as a social media platform has a significant effect on              the  academic performance of the student.                     The  findings  also  showed  the  significant  difference  of  Academic  Performance  of  the                    participants            and their Learning Styles using F-test, the computed value was 3.190 and with the p-value of 0.005,             significant at 0.05 level.

These  exams may  be administered at  any level  of  education,  from primary to  higher  education,                   although  they  are  more  common  at  higher  levels.  It  was  in  the  school  year  1997-1998  when  the  school                   decided to use the standardized test of the CEM. After a few administrations, it was found out that none  was                   able to pass the test or hardly reached an expected score. Due to fear that only a few will be qualified  to enroll                   in  college  which  may  lead  to  bankruptcy,  the  school  decided  to  stop  the  administration  of  the    said                   standardized test by the CEM and returned to using the teacher-made test.                    METHODS                   The  study  used  correlational  research  method.  The  method  was  used  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which                   variations in one factor such as the first year college academic performance correlate with variations in  one                   or more other factors such as college entrance exam results and high school scholastic records based  on the                   correlation  coefficient.  The  primary  data  were  obtained  through  the  entrance  exam  results,  high    school                   scholastic records, and college academic grades from the Office of the Campus Registrar.                    RESULTS                   College entrance exam results of students have fairly satisfactory results. Participant's high school  scholastic                   records and academic performance in college are satisfactory.  There is a significant difference  between the                   college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  in  students'  academic  performance  in                   college. The F-ratio of 46.36 is greater than the F critical value for .05 level of 3.01. The  computed F-ratio                   being  greater  than  the  tabulated  F-ratio  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.    Rejecting  the  null                   hypothesis further proves that college entrance exam results and high school scholastic  records are significant                   to student's academic performance in college.                    DISCUSSIONS                   The  college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  are  significant  to  student's  academic                   performance in college. According to the Campus Registrar, high school records could be a determinant  of                   college  entrance  exam  since  the  students  had  their  high  school  for  four  years  and  the  entrance  exam                   measures  their  gained  knowledge  from  their  previous  education.  It  may  also  the  reason  why  the  college                   entrance exam could also be a determinant of first-year college grades since they are in the adjustment  period                   from at least four years in high school.

These  exams may  be administered at  any level  of  education,  from primary to  higher  education,                   although  they  are  more  common  at  higher  levels.  It  was  in  the  school  year  1997-1998  when  the  school                   decided to use the standardized test of the CEM. After a few administrations, it was found out that none  was                   able to pass the test or hardly reached an expected score. Due to fear that only a few will be qualified  to enroll                   in  college  which  may  lead  to  bankruptcy,  the  school  decided  to  stop  the  administration  of  the    said                   standardized test by the CEM and returned to using the teacher-made test.                    METHODS                   The  study  used  correlational  research  method.  The  method  was  used  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which                   variations in one factor such as the first year college academic performance correlate with variations in  one                   or more other factors such as college entrance exam results and high school scholastic records based  on the                   correlation  coefficient.  The  primary  data  were  obtained  through  the  entrance  exam  results,  high    school                   scholastic records, and college academic grades from the Office of the Campus Registrar.                    RESULTS                   College entrance exam results of students have fairly satisfactory results. Participant's high school  scholastic                   records and academic performance in college are satisfactory.  There is a significant difference  between the                   college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  in  students'  academic  performance  in                   college. The F-ratio of 46.36 is greater than the F critical value for .05 level of 3.01. The  computed F-ratio                   being  greater  than  the  tabulated  F-ratio  means  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected.    Rejecting  the  null                   hypothesis further proves that college entrance exam results and high school scholastic  records are significant                   to student's academic performance in college.                    DISCUSSIONS                   The  college  entrance  exam  results  and  high  school  scholastic  records  are  significant  to  student's  academic                   performance in college. According to the Campus Registrar, high school records could be a determinant  of                   college  entrance  exam  since  the  students  had  their  high  school  for  four  years  and  the  entrance  exam                   measures  their  gained  knowledge  from  their  previous  education.  It  may  also  the  reason  why  the  college                   entrance exam could also be a determinant of first-year college grades since they are in the adjustment  period                   from at least four years in high school.

Modern Technology in communication no doubt has turned the entire world into a “Global             village”  (Asemah and Edegoh, 2012). ). Hence, this research was done to find out the social media,             learning  styles  and  academic  performance  among  the  students  of T3  campuses  of  Cavite  State              University,  namely, Trece Martires City, Tanza and General Trias in order to establish a basis for             enhancement  of     guidance  and  counseling  program..  The  descriptive-comparative  method  of             research  was  utilized  that  investigated  and  described  the  relationship  between  variables  in  their             natural setting without  manipulation.                     Results of the study showed that in general, majority of students used Facebook (81.7 %),             YouTube (50.7 %), and Google+ (26.0 %) while the use of Blogspot and Wordress or Joomla was              only  one. The mean and standard deviation of not using Google + (M=2.05, SD = 0.024) and using             Google+   (M=1.91, SD =0.039).The computed t-value was 3.056 with a p-value of 0.002 which is             significant at             0.05 level. This suggests that using Google+ as a social media platform has a significant effect on              the  academic performance of the student.                     The  findings  also  showed  the  significant  difference  of  Academic  Performance  of  the                    participants            and their Learning Styles using F-test, the computed value was 3.190 and with the p-value of 0.005,             significant at 0.05 level.
