Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): Yes, calendar will be provided to students through Facebook page                the same with the tutorial  which  was presented earlier.  Since this  orientation  is  in FB Live,                students may review or replay the tutorial anytime since this will not be deleted anymore. And                at the same time, during the first week of class orientation, Instructors will discuss again the                process of using the learning platform.                 Question (BSHRM-Trece): When will we have our OJT which are scheduled last Midterm?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): OJTs are allowed if it is online.                 Question (GenTri Student): I am a working student; can I still attend to online classes?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Yes, you may. Because we discourage synchronous classes.                 Question (Trece Student): Are the learning materials downloadable?                Answer (Mr. Ty): Yes, all learning materials once uploaded to the platform are ready for                download anytime as long as you have your device.

Trias Student): How sure that the answers to online exams taken by students                are authentic, since they could search the net while taking the exam?                Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): College set up is different from high school or senior high school.                Examinations are skill based and not knowledge based only. Questions can be reshuffled,                have timer and other strategies, your instructors may set it.                 Question: Which is the best mode of learning?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Modular mode of learning are very risky for everyone. Since, there are                limited transportation and at the same time there is increasing number of COVID cases in the                area. But if you really prefer the modular type, modules will be available in a designated area                in the campus entrance where you can get your modules. But if you want it to be delivered to                your doorsteps, yes, it is possible, but you will shoulder the cost of shipping. But we cannot                give  you  the  whole  semester  module  because  that  is  so  many  pages.  That  is  why  we                discourage the modular type of learning. Unlike online, materials will be uploaded to the LMS                or Google classroom or could be send to you through fb messenger, chat groups, email or                even text messages. Synchronous classes are discouraged, so meaning, if you will have the                online, it is not necessary that you spend load for the data daily for zoom classes, no. We will                have  the  asynchronous  type  of  teaching  and  learning.  Because  our  motto  is  NO  ONE                SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND.                Online is more advantageous, cheaper, or safer rather than modular.                Another thing, we should also invest on this. Especially IT students, not only connectivity but                also having a laptop is necessary in your program.","Question (BSE Student): Do we have the qualifying examination schedule? If ever, will it be                online?                Answer (Mr. Ty): There are previous announcements that it will be scheduled in latter part.                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): The qualifying exam is still face to face and is probably scheduled in                January 2021.                 Question: Do we need to pay for the printing of modules?                Answer (Mr. Ty): No payment. It is free for students because CHED paid for their tuition and                school fees.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How about the academic scholars?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): Only Tulong Dulong and TES are active scholarship grant for this                semester.                 Question (BSE Student): If we have 3-hour virtual class schedule, do we need to attend 3                hours virtual class also?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, we prepared the virtual class schedule for you to be aware of the                available schedule for the teacher for consultation and possible queries or clarifications on the                lesson. This flexible learning is a self-paced learning, so you can do the readings or studying                in  your  convenient  time  not  necessarily  during  the  virtual  class  schedule.  In  addition,                attendance is not part of the grading system for this semester.                Answer  (Prof.  Sedigo):  In  addition,  during  virtual  class  schedule,  that  is  the  time  that  the                teacher will post the lessons and made himself available to students’ consultations.                 Question (Parent): I am an OFW parent, can I monitor my child’s performance in the online                learning platform?                Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes,  if the student  will allow their parents to access his/her account,                he/she will give the username and password of the student.                 Question (New Student): How can we meet our teachers? Are we going to look or contact                them, or they are the one who will contact us?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): Each section has assigned Registration Adviser. They are the one                tasked to look for the students and create a group for the class. Then later, all subject teachers                will be added to the group, so that there will be only one group for each class to elicit confusion                on the part of the student on how to communicate and whom.                 Question  (Irregular  Student):  How  about  if  virtual  class  schedule  is  conflict  with  my  back                subjects, do I need to drop the subject?                Answer (Ms. Anonas): No, flexible learning is self-paced and can do the learning even not                during the virtual class schedule.                 Question: How will the lesson be delivered? Is the lesson/module will be provided for the whole                semester one at a time?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Preparing a module is not the easy but almost all faculty have their                modules for one month or until Midterm except for some that they really have prepared the                whole module for one semester. So module delivery, is by lesson or chapter, so that you will                not be overwhelmed by the lessons and the activities.","Program of Activities","Evaluation Results                              CRITERIA                   PARENTS           STUDENTS           OVERALL                 Meeting your expectation                  4.62               4.18              4.19                 Attainment of the objectives              4.54               4.32              4.33                 Topics discussed                          4.69               4.47              4.47                 Input presentation                        4.69               4.17              4.18                 Management team / Secretariat             4.62               4.29              4.30                 Virtual arrangement                       4.38               4.15              4.16                 Over-all assessment                       4.69               4.38              4.39                           Overall Rating                  4.60               4.28              4.29                 Comments:                1.

Over-all po, okay naman po ang orientation na naganap. Maayos pong sinagot nang mga faculty                    members ang mga katanungan namin at nalinawan po ako.

Overall the virtual presentation was good well explained but there's some technical problems.                16. For me it was good, and because of this virtual orientation I realized that Online learning is not so                    hard :) . God bless!                17. The virtual presentation and orientation itself was very satisfactory, necessary information were                    properly explained and elaborated as well.                18. All of the speakers are good, but there's some interruptions when it comes on presentation.                19. I'm so grateful to have the people who were trying their best to create the education be more                    effective. As a student, I'll pray for the faculty member of Cavsu.

Cahoy            The  proliferation  of  the  COVID-19  hardly  strikes  different  sectors  of  our         country,  from  the  people  to  the  state.  The  four  sections  of  the  economy,         monetary flow inside the country, different industries that create a workplace  for         people, environment sustainability, especially to our health, and even  education.         It  is  just  like  our  world  had  stopped  for  a  minute  or  two  due  to  the  rapid         emergence of this virus. Every Filipino people from different social levels  of the         society  even  those  who are  in the bottom  line  is not an  exemption  from  the         effects of this pandemic. The “high-brows” also cannot think of ways on  how         we  can  still  go  on  in  our  life  in  the  course  of  this  pandemic,  especially  the         opening  of  classes  for  SY  2020-2021  but  there  is  always  a  solution  for         everything.            August  14,  2020,  President  Rodrigo  Duterte  declared  the  opening  of         classes  for the  school  year 2020-2021  will  be  on  October 5,  2020.  It  was  his         answer  concerning  the  recommendation  submitted  by  DepEd  Undersecretary         and  Spokesperson  Atty.  Nepomuceno  Malaluan  on  August  6,  2020.  This         decision  made  by  the  President  and  the  Department  of  Education  had  gone         through numerous deliberations and preparations before they had come up with         this  final  verdict.  Many  people,  specifically  Filipino  mothers  are  fascinated         about how their children can continue studying in midst of the COVID 19. As         we  can  remember,  last  July  17,  2020,  President  Rodrigo  Duterte  signed  the         Republic  Act No. 11480 that amends  the Republic  Act 7797  which  mandates         the opening  of classes between the first Monday  of June until the last day of         August. It states that the school year must start on the first Monday of June but         not later than the last day of August. It was also provided that the Secretary of                                                                                    Digital Poster by Central Student Government         Education may also set a different start date of the school year in the country  due         to an event of the declaration of a state of emergency. After calculating the  pros   opening of class views the tertiary level as an exemption. As an answer to this,         and cons, the Department of Education, despite the Coronavirus disease  2019   Commission on Higher Education Chairperson Prospero de Vera III said that  the         pandemic,  has  set  the  opening  of  classes  for  the  school  year  2020-2021  on    higher education institutions  were  allowed  to adjust  their approved  academic         August 24, 2020, but was suddenly rejected by President Duterte himself until  a   calendars given the coronavirus pandemic. The decision of opening  the class in         vaccine against the virus becomes available. He said that he will not allow  any   tertiary  education  is  mandated  to  the  administration  of  every  college  and         face to face interaction in school to prevent the virus from spreading. In  answer   university as it was covered to the CHED Law or the Republic Act No.  7722         to  this,  DepEd  said  to  implement  a  blended  learning  program  wherein  the   which states that it allows colleges and universities to exercise their  academic         learning process will be set to modules, televisions, radios, and the internet  as a   freedom,  such  as  the  opening  of  classes.

Citizens from that time were confused about  when is the   pandemic.  He  also  added  that  all  universities  and  colleges  can’t  open  their         proper date for the opening of classes. Many things are needed to  consider and   school year at the same time as they differ in terms of their academic calendars.         for them to start again into scratch represents the passion to go on  and to still   In  consideration  of  this,  colleges  and  universities  should  still  work                                                               collaboratively  with  the  IATF  and  assess  the  students  as  well  as  teachers’         fight.

De Jesus        Batangas smelled of strong sulfuric gas. Soon after        were  the  unusual  black  ashes  that  seemed  to  fall        from  the  skies.  After  tuning  in  the  television,        listening to radio reports, and checking on different        social  media  platforms,  news  of  the  Taal  Volcano        eruption  circulated  as  fast as  its monstrous  strike.        From a serene tiny volcano to an extreme madman-        like behavior posing danger to all the neighboring        areas.           Since  its  last  eruption  43  years  ago  in  1977,        nobody  expected  that  the  Taal  volcano  will  again        display its violent strength. According to  PHILVOLCS        Director  Dr.  Renato  Solidum,  the  volcano  started        seismic activities around 11 am and  finally erupted        at 1 pm Philippine Standard Time.  It was ultimately        advised  to  avoid  settlement  near  Taal,  as  the        concerned  agency  spontaneously  raised  the        volcanoes’ alert level from Level 2 at 2:30 pm  due        to its steam-driven, phreatic  eruption, then  turned        Alert Level 3 at 4 pm indicating “magmatic  unrest’,        and was raised further to Alert level 4  (hazardous        eruption  imminent)  at  7:30  pm  in  which  the  ash        and  rock fragments  had  reached up  to 10-15  km        due to its continuous eruption, thus placing  Cavite        and  Batangas  under “state  of  calamity”.  Volcanic        alert  level  status  starts  from  level  1  being  the        lowest, and alert level 5 being the highest, in  which        Taal  volcano,  the  worlds’  smallest  supervolcano        and one of the most dangerous, is  capable of.           Taal’s      volcanic      activities     continuously        progressed,   resulting   in   severe   earthquakes   in        Batangas  and  Cavite  particularly  in  Talisay  and           Photo by Atty.

Why there is a rainbow after the rain?          Honestly, being love is the greatest part of our life,         It is one of our fuel to live,         Like a plant that needs water to grow,         Always brings us hope.          Love gave us a different kind of emotions,         Like reading a fairytale story before going to sleep,         Like a flower in the garden that blooms from         within,         Bringing us to such a wonderful feeling.          Love is a Hope, a gift from above,         It motivates us to go farther from our dreams.         It gives us vitamins to step on and hold on to,         It's guiding us to reach our goal.          Love teaches us that there is always a Hope,         In our Study, In our Career, and, In our Life.         We can be whoever we wanted to be,         If there's a Storm in our path,         there's a rainbow in the end.         Along with Love, Hope exists.

Question (BSP 1-Trece): How would be the distribution of modules and submission of                activities  for those who prefer modular mode of learning?

Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): Yes, calendar will be provided to students through Facebook                page  the same with the tutorial  which  was presented earlier.  Since this  orientation  is  in                FB Live,                students may review or replay the tutorial anytime since this will not be deleted anymore.                And  at the same time, during the first week of class orientation, Instructors will discuss                again the                process of using the learning platform.                 Question (BSHRM-Trece): When will we have our OJT which are scheduled last Midterm?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): OJTs are allowed if it is online.                 Question (GenTri Student): I am a working student; can I still attend to online classes?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Yes, you may. Because we discourage synchronous classes.                 Question (Trece Student): Are the learning materials downloadable?                Answer (Mr. Ty): Yes, all learning materials once uploaded to the platform are ready for                download anytime as long as you have your device.                 Question (First Year Student): Are we required to attend online class in uniform? Do we                need  to buy one?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, just wear appropriate outfit that is appealing to the class.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How sure that the answers to online exams taken by                students  are authentic, since they could search the net while taking the exam?                Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): College set up is different from high school or senior high school.                Examinations are skill based and not knowledge based only. Questions can be                reshuffled,                have timer and other strategies, your instructors may set it.                 Question: Which is the best mode of learning?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Modular mode of learning are very risky for everyone. Since, there are                limited transportation and at the same time there is increasing number of COVID cases in                the  area. But if you really prefer the modular type, modules will be available in a designated                area   in  the  campus  entrance  where  you  can  get  your  modules.  But  if you  want  it  to  be                delivered to  your doorsteps, yes, it is possible, but you will shoulder the cost of shipping. But                we cannot  give you the whole semester module because that is so many pages. That is why                we  discourage the modular type of learning. Unlike online, materials will be uploaded to the                LMS    or  Google  classroom  or  could  be  send  to  you  through  fb  messenger,  chat  groups,                email or  even text messages. Synchronous classes are discouraged, so meaning, if you will                have the  online, it is not necessary that you spend load for the data daily for zoom classes,                no. We will  have the asynchronous type of teaching and learning. Because our motto is NO                ONE  SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND.                Online is more advantageous, cheaper, or safer rather than modular.                Another thing, we should also invest on this. Especially IT students, not only connectivity but                also having a laptop is necessary in your program.","Question (BSE Student): Do we have the qualifying examination schedule? If ever, will it be                online?                Answer (Mr. Ty): There are previous announcements that it will be scheduled in latter part.                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): The qualifying exam is still face to face and is probably scheduled in                January 2021.                 Question: Do we need to pay for the printing of modules?                Answer (Mr. Ty): No payment. It is free for students because CHED paid for their tuition and                school fees.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How about the academic scholars?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): Only Tulong Dulong and TES are active scholarship grant for this                semester.                 Question (BSE Student): If we have 3-hour virtual class schedule, do we need to attend 3                hours virtual class also?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, we prepared the virtual class schedule for you to be aware of the                available schedule for the teacher for consultation and possible queries or clarifications on                the                lesson. This flexible learning is a self-paced learning, so you can do the readings or studying                in  your  convenient  time  not  necessarily  during  the  virtual  class  schedule.  In  addition,                attendance is not part of the grading system for this semester.                Answer  (Prof.  Sedigo):  In  addition,  during  virtual  class  schedule,  that  is  the  time  that  the                teacher will post the lessons and made himself available to students’ consultations.                 Question (Parent): I am an OFW parent, can I monitor my child’s performance in the online                learning platform?                Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, if the student will allow their parents to access his/her account,                he/she will give the username and password of the student.                 Question (New Student): How can we meet our teachers? Are we going to look or contact                them, or they are the one who will contact us?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): Each section has assigned Registration Adviser. They are the one                tasked to look for the students and create a group for the class. Then later, all subject teachers                will be added to the group, so that there will be only one group for each class to elicit                confusion  on the part of the student on how to communicate and whom.                 Question  (Irregular  Student):  How  about  if  virtual  class  schedule  is  conflict  with  my  back                subjects, do I need to drop the subject?                Answer (Ms. Anonas): No, flexible learning is self-paced and can do the learning even not                during the virtual class schedule.                 Question: How will the lesson be delivered? Is the lesson/module will be provided for the                whole  semester one at a time?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Preparing a module is not the easy but almost all faculty have their                modules for one month or until Midterm except for some that they really have prepared the                whole module for one semester. So module delivery, is by lesson or chapter, so that you will                not be overwhelmed by the lessons and the activities.","Program of Activities","Evaluation Results                              CRITERIA                  PARENTS           STUDENTS           OVERALL                 Meeting your expectation                 4.62               4.18              4.19                 Attainment of the objectives             4.54               4.32              4.33                 Topics discussed                         4.69               4.47              4.47                 Input presentation                       4.69               4.17              4.18                 Management team / Secretariat            4.62               4.29              4.30                 Virtual arrangement                      4.38               4.15              4.16                 Over-all assessment                      4.69               4.38              4.39                          Overall Rating                  4.60               4.28              4.29                 Comments:                1.
