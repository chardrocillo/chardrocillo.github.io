HUMBLE BEGINNINGS                         The University has its humble beginning in 1906 as the Indang Intermediate School with the                American “ Thomasites” as the first teachers. Several transformations in the name of the school took                place. In 1918 – Indang Farm School, 1927 – Indang Rural High School and then to Don Severino National                Agricultural in 1958. The name Don Severino is donated in the Aguinaldo revolutionary government.                Don Severino donated a tract of land for use as field laboratory by the School.                  AS A ATATE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE                         In 1964, the School was converted into a State College by virtue of Republic Act No. 3917 and                became known as Don Severino Agricultural College.                         In the beginning of its establishment as a State College, the only program offering was                baccalaureate degree in agriculture including the teacher training program in agriculture education.                However, due to the demands of parents and in answer to the challenges of Project CALABARZON,                major program units such as Arts and Sciences, Education, and Engineering were created in addition to                the School of Agriculture in 1992.","In 1993, in recognition of its achievements and potentials, the College was designated by the                Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) as the regional College of Agriculture (RCA), for the                Southern Tagalog Region. Being the RCA, DSAC is mandated to assist the Provincial Technical Institutes                of Agriculture (PTIA) in the region in the improvement of their curriculum and instructional programs,                practical and applied researches, the training of PTIA staff and to lead in the production of instructional                materials.                 AS A STATE UNIVERSITY                         On January 22, 1998, by virtue of Republic Act No. 8468, DSAC was converted into CAVITE STATE                UNIVERSITY (CvSU). Two years later, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) designated the                University as Center of Development in Agriculture and Agricultural Engineering and in 2009, the                Veterinary Medicine.

SUSPENSION OF CLASSES                      a)  Authority to Suspend Classes. The University President has the final authority to suspend                        classes throughout the University including all units or branches, or he may suspend classes in                        specific units or campuses for specified periods of time. Suspension of classes does not mean                        that faculty and employees will not report for duty.                                       The suspension, dismissal or postponement of classes in any academic unit by                               the dean concerned should have previous authority from the President except in                               emergency cases when the dean or campus administrator immediately issues an order                               for the suspension of classes after which he shall make a report to the President on the                               circumstances which compelled such action.                     b)  Bases of Suspenson of Classes. Classes are suspended primarily to assure the safety of students                        upon the advent, usually unexpected calamities, and forces of nature such as typhoons,                        earthquakes and tsunamis.                                       With respect to typhoons, classes will be suspended upon advice of Philippine                               Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Authority (PAG-ASA) whenever the                               typhoon is of sufficient intensity to make it advisable to suspend classes in the                               elementary grade and moreover when the approach of the typhoon becomes ore                               definitely pronounced as to require suspension of classes in the high school and                               collegiate levels as well. Aside from such official announcements to be made, classes                               may be considered automatically suspended in the elementary grades when reports                               throughout the mass media confirm the raising of typhoon Signal No.2, the suspension                               to apply furthermore to all high school and collegiate levels if typhoon signal is raised to                               Typhoon Signal No. 3.                                       The University President may likewise automatically suspend classes even if the                               typhoon signal is below 3 but is accompanied by unabated torrential rains resulting to                               heavy floods and/or landslides.                                       With respect to earthquakes, those of serious intensity require immediate                               suspension of classes to enable an inspection of the building and premises where classes                               are being held. A general rule to follow upon announcement of PAG-ASA is that the                               intensity of the tremor is at least Intensity V to allow a 24-hour period from time of the                               earthquake as the duration of the suspension of classes.","Other force majeure and fortuitous events or circumstances which may compel                               immediate suspension of classes are fires, epidemics and bombs threats which will be                               dealt with accordingly as the occasion arises.                                       Classes are also suspended for short periods of time to enable students to                               attend University convocations or special gathering. However these are pre-schedules=d                               events for which announcement are circulated in advance.                                       In the absence of the University President, the person next in rank in the                               hierarchy of command succession adopted by the University shall decide on the                               suspension of classes.
