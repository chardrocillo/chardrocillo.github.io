Included  in  the  Region’s  agenda            is technological innovation to address the            development challenges.             Calabarzon  as  an  industrial  hub  of  the            country  has  to  rise  to  the  challenge  of            sustaining  economic  growth.  These  challenges  include  affordable  and            reliable  power  sources,  competitive  products,  modernization  of  industry,            business continuity after disasters and job-skills mismatch among others.            The policies to address these challenges have to be based on studies.             The  RDC  is  grateful  to  the  Regional  Research  Committee,  Calabarzon            Research  Consortia  and  other  government  agencies  for  crafting  the            Calabarzon Regional Development Research Agenda (RDRA) 2018-2022.             The Calabarzon RDRA 2018-2022 shall serve as a guide to researchers. I            enjoin all scientists and researchers in Calabarzon to continue to discover            new  technological  innovations,  processes,  systems  and  procedures  to            propel our Region to greater heights.

Introduction                 Research  is  a  tool  to  establish  or  confirm  facts,  validate  previous                researches,  solve  problems,  support  and/or  develop  new  theories.  It                comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis to increase                the stock of knowledge. Development challenges could be addressed                with  the  increase  in  the  stock  of  knowledge  generated  by  new                research results.                 In pursuit of sustainable and inclusive growth, research plays a critical                role  in  helping  the  government  formulate  better  policies,  plans,                programs,  projects  and  strategies.  The  Calabarzon  Regional                Development Plan (RDP) 2017-2022 includes priority research agenda                to address development gaps.                 The  Region  ranks  first  nationwide  in  terms  of  Research  and                Development    (R\&D)  expenditure  ratio  to  gross  regional  domestic                product in 2013 at 0.26 percent. The Region surpassed NCR with only                0.19  percent  which  ranked  number  one  in  2011.  This  shows                recognition of the Region on the importance of R\&D activities to spur                economic and social growth. However, this is still below the standard                set  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural                Organization   (UNESCO)     of   one   percent   for   R\&D    of                developing countries.                 Knowledge  is  highly  recognized  as  a  driver  of  economic  growth  and                social  wellbeing.  Proper  use  of  information  to  create  value  adding                knowledge    is   beneficial   to   productivity   enhancement   and                competitiveness.  Consequently,  all  actors  involved  in  science,                technology  and  innovation  are  important  to  translate  results  of  R\&D                activities into  appropriate technology and  innovations that  will benefit                the society.

Priority Research Areas                 a)  Industry and Services                     The  Industry  sector  is  the  main  economic  growth  driver  as  it                    comprises 61.9 percent of the Region’s economic output in 2017.                    The  Region  remains  as  the  industrial  powerhouse  of  the  country                    having the largest share of the country’s total industry output. The                    Manufacturing  sub-sector  is  the  largest  contributor  of  the  sector                    and  in  the  Region’s  economy  with  a  53.2  percent  share.  The                    Services  sector  is  the  second  contributor  of  the  Region’s  total                    economic  output  with  a  33.2  percent  share.  Business  activities,                    trade and repair, and transport are the main drivers of this sector.                     Having the largest share of economic output of both the industry                    and services, these sectors are faced with challenges that have to                    be    addressed     with   new     knowledge,    innovations                    and strategies.

Its share in the working age population to the country’s                    total  is  around  14  percent  which  will  be  able  to  support  the                    manpower  needs  of  various  industries.  While  the  size  of  the                    working  age  population  matters,  the  quality  of  labor  force  is                    important. Thus, the Region should implement appropriate policies,                    programs  and  projects  to  ensure  that  the  young  will  acquire  the                    needed human capital that would match the industry requirements.                     While  the  Region  is  second  to  NCR  in  terms  of  the  number  of                    higher  education  institutions,  the  number  of  HEIs  with  centers  of                    excellence and center of development are below that of NCR and                    other  regions.  This  indicates  the  need  to  encourage  the  HEIs  to                    participate  in  the  various  accreditation  processes  and  imrpove                    quality  in  higher  education.  In  2015,  the  region  recorded  in  the                    decrease of malnutrition among children 0-71 months from seven                    percent in 2014 to five percent.                     In  terms  of  elementary  education,  around  8.09  percent  of  the                    school age population were not able to attend elementary school.                    This maybe attributed to employment stands of parents and lack of                    personal interest among others.                     Having cited some of the hurdles in social development, research                    studies on this sector are critical on how these issues emanate and                    how  to  address  them  effectively  to  make  development  more                    inclusive.

The research outputs                    aim  to  introduce  innovations  and  new  technologies,  and                    automation  of  processes  and  procedures  to  improve  delivery  of                    public service.                     Attaining Just and Lasting Peace                     It has been observed that conflict affected areas in the Region are                    contiguous  municipalities  at  the  southern  tip  of  Quezon  province                    which  have  poverty  incidence  greater  than  20  percent  based  on                    the 2012 Small Area Poverty Estimates. Lack of awareness of the                    populace on land issues and insufficient delivery of basic services                    are the main reasons for the existence of insurgency in the area.                    Calabarzon being an industrial region also is susceptible to internal                    conflict.  Labor  disputes  could  result  in  insurgency  when  rebel                    groups intervene in behalf of the labor sector.                     Ensuring Regional Security, Public Order and Safety                    Calabarzon  has  a  generally  peaceful  environment.  The  use  of                    programmatic  and  sustainable  approaches  to  combat  criminality                    resulted in a notable decrease in crime incidence.                     To  attain  national  security,  public  order  and  safety,  the  following                    objectives will have to be pursued:                       Uphold  and  protect  the  territorial  integrity  and  sovereignty  of                        the country;                       Reduce all forms of criminality;                       Ensure public safety; and                       Protect the welfare and well-being of all Filipinos overseas.
