Workman, an American,                    as its first principal.**                            Mr.  Henry  Wise  succeeded  Mr.  Workman,  and  then  followed  by  Mr.                    Joseph Cocannoer. In 1915, Dr. Mariano Mondonedo took over as its first                    Filipino  principal.  During  this  time,  Intermediate  classes  were  maintained                    with emphasis on Vocational Agriculture for boys and Domestic Science for                    girls.                            In 1918, the name of the school was changed to Indang Farm School.                            The  school  site  was  expanded  through  donations  of  civic–minded                    citizens of Indang. Notable among the donors were: Don Francisco Ocampo                    and  Don  Severino  de  las  Alas,  who  was  then  the  Secretary  of  Interior  in                    General Aguinaldo‘s Cabinet.                            In 1923, Secondary Vocational Agriculture courses were offered.                            Mr. Simeon Madlangsakay became the school principal in 1927 and                    the name of the school was changed to Indang Rural High School. At this                    time, Secondary Home Economics courses were offered for girls.                            In  1958,  in  recognition  of  the  contributions  of  Don  Severino  de  las                    Alas  to  the  community,  to  the  province  of  Cavite  and  to  the  country,  the                    name  of  the  institution  was  changed  by  Congressional  initiative  to  Don                    Severino National Agricultural School.                            In 1964, through the bill by Rep. Justiniano Montano, Sr., the school                    was converted into a state college . It was called Don Severino Agricultural                    College (DSAC)  by  virtue of R.A.  No. 3917. Mr. Vicente G. Hicaro  was the                    officer in charge.                     *Recast of Brief History of Cavite State  University , R.S. Sangalang  and Antonio G.

Mr.  Vicente  Pinazo  became  its  second  College  President  in  1971.  A                    Certificate  in  Technical  Agriculture  was  introduced  as  a  post  –  secondary                    course in addition to the Bachelor of Science in Agricultural (BSA) and BS in                    Agricultural  Education  (BSAg.  Ed).  The  Faculty  and  Staff  Development                    Program  (FSDP)  was  started  by  sending  faculty  members  to  take  up                    graduate studies at the University of the Philippines Los Banes (UPLB).                            The  research  and  extension  functions  of  the  College  became  in                    operation in 1976 with the establishment of research and extension services                    projects.                            The years from 1978 to 1982 were considered to be the development                    period for the institution.                            In  1980,  DSAC  became  one  of  the  seven  participants  –beneficiary                    state  institution  in  the  Agricultural  Education  Outreach  Project  (AEOP).                    AEOP was a three –year innovative extension strategy jointly funded by the                    Government of the Philippines through the National Economic Development                    Authority (NEDA) and the United States Government through the US Agency                    for International Development (USAID).                            During  this  development  period,  the  mission  of  the  College  was  “to                    provide  quality  and  affordable  education  to  the  socially  and  economically                    disadvantaged. It shall provide instruction research and extension services in                    the  arts,  sciences,  technology  and  literature  toward  the  development  of                    individuals with applied orientations in their chosen careers.”                            From 1983 to 1987, the stage was set in preparation for DSAC toward                    university status.                            After Pres. Pinazo‘s death in 1983, Dr. Ruperto S. Sangalang became                    the  officer-in-charge,  later  acting President,  and  then  became  full-  fledged                    President of the College.                            School  Year  1983-1984  saw  the  offering  of  Agricultural  Science                    Curriculum,  a  special  research–oriented  curriculum  for  academically                    superior  students.  Two  senior  students,  Shiela  Marie  Rupido  and  Syd                    Lorence Ernie, were named Outstanding Junior Scientists and represented                    the  Philippines  in  the  Science  Congress  in  Thailand  in  1991  and  1992,                    respectively.                            Additional  degree  courses,  both  in  the  graduate  and  undergraduate                    levels,  were  offered  later,  along  with  the  non–degree  courses.  One  of  the                                                                                                            2","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  3                      non-degree  courses  offered  in  1988  for  the  out–of–school  youth  was  the                    Sanayan  Sa  Kakayahang  Agrikultura  (SAKA).  SAKA  was  an  innovative                    agricultural  skills  training  on  coconut–based  farming  system  which  was                    more on hands –on approach to agriculture. SAKA was a joint program of                    DSAC and the Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.                            In  the  field  of  extension  service,  the  College  became  part  of  the                    network of the UP Los Banos–based Barangay    Integrated   Development                    Approach for Nutrition Improvement of the Rural Poor (BIDANI), a problem-                    based approach for nutrition improvement in the barangays.                            Likewise, the college became an active partner of the Department of                    Science and Technology (DOST) and the Department of Trade and Industry                    and was designated as the National Training and Demonstration Center for                    Fruit  and  Vegetable  –  Based  Products  (NTDC-FVBP).  DSAC  was  also                    designated  as  the  Affiliated  Non-Conventional  Energy  Center  (ANEC)  for                    Region IV by the Department of Energy (DOE).                            Through the various linkage institutions, the college implemented the                    Institutional  Development  Assistance  and  Cooperation  Project  with  the                    University  of  the  Philipines  Los  Banes  (UPLB)  ,  as  the  lead    institution.                    UPLB assisted the college in the strengthening of its instruction, research                    and extension programs.                            To address the changing needs of the clientele brought about by the                    agro-modernization  and  industrialization  in  the  CALABARZON  (Cavite                    Batangas, Laguna, Rizal, Quezon) area and to prepare the academe for the                    university  status,  the  College  instituted  four  component  schools  in  1992.                    These were the Schools of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and                    Education.                            On  27  August  1993,  the  college  was  designated  by  the  Educational                    Projects  Implementing  Task  Force  (EDPITAF)  and  the  Bureau  of  Higher                    Education  (BHE)  of  the  Department  of  Education,  Culture  and  Sports                    (DECS)  as  the  Regional  College  of  Agriculture  (RCA)  for  the  Southern                    Tagalog,  in  recognition  of  its  potentials  and  achievements.  This  was  in                    connection with the Philippine Australian Agriculture Technology Education                    Project (PAATEP).                            Being  the  Regional  College  for  Region  IV,  DSAC  was  mandated  to                    assist the five (5) Provincial Technical Institutes of Agriculture (PTIAs) in the                    region in the improvement of their curricula and instructional programs, in                    practical  and  applied  researches,  conduct  of  training,  and  lead  in  the                    production of instructional materials.                                                                                                               3","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  4                              On  30  January  1997,  the  College  launched  the  Open  University                    System (OPS) and started to offer short term courses to various sectors.                            Finally, on January 22, 1998, DSAC was converted into Cavite State                    University  (CvSU)  by  virtue  of  Republic  Act  No.  8468.  Dr.  Sangalang,  the                    appointed first University, said “It is both fitting and proper for the province of                    Cavite to have its own State University in view of the centennial celebration                    of  the  Philippine    Independence    in  1998.  A  University  for  the  province                    underscores  the  leading  role  that  Cavite  played  during  the  Philippine                    Revolution. The University serves as  an  eloquent  testimony  of the kind  and                    care and attention the government is giving to deserving Cavitenos, many of                    whom  are  descendants  of  the  gallant  revolutionaries  who  laid  down  their                    lives so  that  we  of the latter generations may live  in peace  in  a democratic                    society.”                            As a consequence of the conversion of the college into university: the                    four schools were elevated into full pledge colleges.  These were:  College of                    Agriculture,  Forestry,  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (CAFENR);                    College of Arts and Sciences (CAS); College of Education (CEd); and College                    of Engineering (CEng).                            Two  new  colleges  were  created:  The  College  of  Economics,                    Management and Development Studies (CEMDS), and the College of Sports,                    Physical Education and Recreation (CSPEAR). The Open University System                    was renamed Open Learning College (OLC). The Graduate School remained                    in  operations  with  four  extramural  learning  centers,  namely:  the  Cavite                    College  of  Fisheries  in  Naic,  Cavite,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  in  Sta.

Since  the  School  Year  1996-1997,  16  programs  were  offered  on                    Doctorate  and  Masters  degrees  and  post  B.S.  diploma  in  various  fields,                    majority of which were in agriculture and related fields.                            The Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program was offered in the School                    Year  1997-1998  and  subsequently,  in  the  year  2000,  the  College  of                    Veterinary Medicine was established.                            In consonance with the implementation of the Agriculture and Fishery                    Modernization  Act  (AFMA)  of  1997,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA)                    tapped the University as one of the members of the National Research                     Development  and  Extension  System  Networks  (NRDESN).

Assignment of Affiliate Faculty Members. An affiliate faculty                        member is one who has his/her mother college but is also teaching in                        other college(s)/campus because of his/her diversity of specialization or                        full knowledge of the subject(s) (BOR Res. No. 64, s, 2003, December 3,                        2003).                            A faculty member can get teaching load in another college(s)/ campus                        as long as he/she is competent to teach the proposed subject(s) because                        these  are  either  in  line  with  his/her  minor  field(s)  or  he/she  has                        undergone retooling through intensive training.

This is on                           the  assumption  that  the  faculty  member  has  pre  –  determined  the                           subjects  he/she  can  possibly  teach  in  other  college(s).

Suspension of Classes                                a)  Authority  to  Suspend  Classes.  The  University  President                                  has   the  final  authority  to  suspend  classes  throughout                                  the  University  including  all  units  or  branches,  or  he  may                                  suspend  classes  in  specific  units  or  campuses  for  specified                                  periods of time. Suspension of classes does not   mean                 that                                  faculty and employees will not report for duty.                                           The suspension, dismissal or postponement of classes in                                  any   academic  unit  by  the  dean  concerned  should  have                                  previous       authority  from  the  President  except  in  emergency                                  cases when  the  dean  or  campus  administrator  immediately                                  issue  an  order  for  the  suspension  of  classes  after  which  he                                  shall  make  a  report  to  the  President  on  the  circumstances                                  which compelled such   action.                               b)  Bases  of  Suspension  of  Classes.  Classes  are  suspended                                  primarily  to  assure  the  safety  of  students  upon  the  advent,                                  usually  unexpected  calamities,  and  forces  of  nature  such  as                                  typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis.                                              With  respect  to  typhoons,  classes  will  be  suspended                                  upon  advice  of  the  Philippine  Atmospheric  Geophysical  and                                  Astronomical  Services  Authority  (PAG-ASA)  whenever  the                                  typhoon is of sufficient   intensity  to  make  it  advisable  to                                  suspend classes in the   elementary  grade  and  moreover  when                                  the  approach  of  the  typhoon  becomes  more  definitely                                  pronounced  as  to  require  suspension  of  classes  in  the  high                                  school and collegiate levels as  well.  Aside  from  such  official                                  announcements  to  be  made,  classes  may  be  considered                                  automatically suspended in the elementary grades when reports                                  throughout  the  mass  media  confirm  the  raising  of  Typhoon                                  Signal  No.2,  the  suspension  to  apply  furthermore  to  all  high                                  school and collegiate levels if typhoon signal is raised to                                  Typhoon Signal No. 3.                                                                                                               83","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  84                                            The  University  President  may  likewise  automatically                                  suspend  classes  even  if  the  Typhoon  Signal  is  below  3  but  is                                  accompanied  by  unabated  torrential  rains  resulting  to  heavy                                  floods and/or landslides.                                           With  respect  to  earthquakes,  those  of  serious  intensity                                  require immediate suspension of classes to enable an inspection                                  of  the  building  and  premises  where  classes  are  being  held.  A                                  general rule to follow upon announcement of PAG-ASA is that                                  the intensity of the tremor is at least Intensity V to allow a 24-                                  hour period from time of the earthquake as the duration of the                                  suspension of classes.                                           Other     force    majeure      and     fortuitous     events     or                                  circumstances  which  may  compel  immediate  suspension  of                                  classes  are  fires,  epidemics  and  bomb  threats  which  will  be                                  dealt with accordingly as the occasion arise.                                           Classes  are  also  suspended  for  short  periods  of  time  to                                  enable  students  to  attend  University  convocations  or  special                                  gathering.  However,  these  are  pre-scheduled  events  for  which                                  announcements are circulated in advance.                                           In  the  absence  of  the  University  President,  the  person                                  next in rank in the hierarchy of command succession adopted                                  by the University shall decide on the suspension of classes.

The Board Resolution approving the offering                                          of  the  new  program(s)  together  with  the  above                                          requirements  shall  be  submitted  to  the  CHED  Central                                          Office for MIS purposes and to the CHED Regional Office                                          for information and reference purposes.                                    e)   Forms.  The  documents  and  other  requirements  should                                          conform  to  the  forms  provided  by  CHED  in  the  above                                          cited Memorandum Letter.                                     f)   Course  Number  System.  In  addition  to  the  CHED                                          requirements,  the  number  of  courses  in  revised  or                                          proposed  program  should  conform  to  the  course                                          numbering system being adopted by the University.                                    g)   Phase  Out  Program.  A  phase-out  program  should  be                                          anticipated  in  the  implementation  of  new  or  revised                                          programs                                          If  the  new  program  is  designed  to  replace  an  existing                                  curriculum, the implementation should start from the incoming                                  freshmen  only  and  the  old  curriculum  should  end  with  the                                  graduation of the current students taking it.                                          In  the  revised  courses,  the  compulsory  requirement  for                                  students for the introduced/revised courses should start only in                                  the  current  year  they  are  supposed  to  take  the  course.  In  no                                  case shall the introduced/revised courses  be required as back                                  subjects for students.                                   h)      Schedule of Revision/Introduction of New Courses.                                          Unless the revision or introduction of new required course                                  is  a  mandatory  requirement  by  CHED,  no  revision  on  any                                  curriculum of the University shall be made within five (5) years                                  of its implementation.                    Section 5.   Program  Accreditation.  The  University  shall  as  much  as                               possible, submit all programs for accreditation particularly by the                               Accrediting  of  Chartered  Colleges  and  Universities  in  the                               Philippines  (AACCUP)  or  any  accrediting  agency  prescribed  by                               CHED  and  the  Philippine  Association  of  State  Universities  and                               Colleges (PASUC).                                  Relevant to this, the University President shall form a   local                               University-wide  accrediting  body  to  be  headed  by  the  Director  for                               Quality Assurance and Accreditation. It is the duty of this body to                               prepare  for  the  accreditation  of  programs,  including  review  and                               inspection of documents (local         accreditation)       and      schedule                               accreditation visits.                                                                                                              86","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  87                                    The  University  may  tap  the  services  of  other  accrediting                               institutions or other outside agencies.                    Section 6.  Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.                            a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary                                  level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set                                  schedule.                                           The  Office  of  the  University  Registrar  is  tasked  to                                  policy     and      oversight      to     course      scheduling.       The                                  College/Department is   furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of                                  courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to                                  decide  faculty  assignment.  The  Department  Head,  through                                  the  Dean/Director,  coordinates  with  the  Office  of  the                                  University     Registrar     on    matters      concerning      the    final                                  scheduling  of  courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty                                  schedules  are  prepared  by  the  Department  Head  after  due                                  consultations  with  the  faculty  members.  The  assignment  of                                  loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution                                  governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to                                  faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the                                  semester  to  give  them  enough  time  to  prepare.  Loads  are                                  considered  final  once approved  by  the  Dean  and  submitted  to                                  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  The                                  Department  Head  and  Dean  of  the  College  sign  the  official                                  Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office                                  of the University President.                           b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as                                  approved  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be                                  observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes                                  for  instruction  or  consultation  purposes  on  schedule.  Faculty                                  members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of                                  their department head and dean should there be changes in the                                  schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and                                  students  are  not  allowed.  Any  deviation  from  the  approved                                  schedule  should  be  communicated  to  the  Office  of  the                                  University Registrar.                           c.) Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a                                      class:                                                    Undergraduate                    — forty (40) students                                                   Specialization/Majorship — fifteen (15) students                                                    Masters                           — ten (10) students                                                   Doctoral                         — eight (8) students                                                                                                              87","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  88                                                     Special class- below         --  ten (10) students;                                    Should  the  class  size  fall  below  the  minimum  number,  the                               Department  Head  should  be  informed  immediately  to  decide                               whether  to  dissolve  the  class  or  to  maintain  it  as  a  special  class                               approved by the Dean of the College. Should the class be dissolved,                               faculty  members  should  advise  the  student  to  transfer  to  other                               classes.                           d)    First  Day  of  Classes.  During  the  first  day  of  classes,  faculty                               members should sign the registration forms of their students and                               collect their class cards or registration forms. The class cards serve                               as evidence that the students are officially enrolled in the class.                                          A  student  is  considered  officially  enrolled  only  after  the                                          following steps are satisfied:                                        University Registrar has duly certified the enrollment on                                          the registration cards.                                           University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an                                          acknowledgement of payment of fees, and                                         Professors/instructors  have  placed  their  initials  or                                          signatures on the registration cards.                                      The  class  list,  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  University                               Registrar, provides the name of the students, regular or irregular,                               officially  enrolled  in  a  course.  Faculty  members  should  get  their                               class lists from their Department Head on the first day of classes.                                          Moreover,  faculty  members  should  orient  the  students                               about the objectives, contents and requirements of the course, and                               explain  the  bases  for  evaluating  students‘  performance.  It  is                               recommended  that  the  students  be  provided  with  a  copy  of  the                               course syllabus.                            e)  Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should  be                               observed at all times in the conduct of classes. If the class should                               start at 7 a.m., the faculty should be in the classroom at exactly                                 7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before                               the end of each period to allow students to move and transfer to                               their next class.                            f) Make-Up Classes.

While  in  college/campus,                                 many  students  experience  personal  difficulties  that  can  be                                 exacerbated by the  challenges  of  maturation,  an  unfamiliar                                 environment,  and  academic  pressure  or  stiff  competition.  Some                                 students resolve their difficulties  over time on their own, a few,                                 however, are able to do so only with professional help.                                     Guidance  and  counseling  services  are  available  for  all                                 students at the OSA. Such services can involve the assessment of                                 students‘ difficulties in their studies, through appropriate testing                                 and assessment mechanisms, for the individual student to realize                                 his /her full potential.                                   Faculty  members  are,  therefore,  encouraged  to  refer  students                                 who have problems to the Office of Student Affairs (OSA).

Policies and Guidelines on Administrative Matters                                   a)      Conduct of Official Business                                           Travels.  When  faculty  members  deem  it  necessary  to                                          travel  domestically  or  internationally  for  research                                          purposes,  observation  or  study,  the  President,  in  his                                          discretion,  may  authorize  the  college  to  allot  from  its                                          appropriation  for  Traveling  Expenses  of  Personnel,  such                                          amount as may be necessary for travel. Faculty members                                          should inform the President in writing the details at least                                          two  weeks  before  the  planned  travel  to  obtain  the                                          approval and confirmation of support from the University.                                                 Travels may be official, religious, social or personal                                          in nature contingent on the needs of the service; hence,                                          approval for authority to travel is needed when a faculty                                          represents University functions, as the trip is sponsored                                          by the University or a sponsoring inviting agency.                                           Field  Trips.  Faculty  members  are  encouraged  to  plan                                          field trips for ocular or on-the-spot education of students.                                          It is expected that these field trips be carefully correlated                                          with  the  subject  matter  of  the  course.

Before undertaking                                          the trip, the department head may require that  a  written                                          consent  or  waiver  of  parents  be  submitted  and                                          accomplished  by  the  students  at  least  three  days  in                                          advance  and  countersigned  by  the  Dean  of  Student                                          Affairs.                                                  If a school transport facility is desired, the faculty                                          member  should  accomplish  and  submit  an  application                                          form  for  this  purpose  available  at  the  office  of  the  Vice                                          President  for  Administrative  and  Support  Services  for                                          approval and confirmation.                                   b)     Dress  Code.

Article 5. Student’s Participation in Co-curricular Activities.  Freedom                        of  expression  which  subsumes  free  speech,  press,  and  assembly  is  an                        inalienable and cherished right that is enshrined and guaranteed by the                        Philippine Constitution and existing laws as well as national policies and                        democratic traditions.

Freedom of expression is the mother of all human rights and for                        as  long  as  this  freedom  subsists;  violation or  vitiation of  rights  can  be                        protested  and  denounced  and thus  rights  are  protected  and  preserved.                        Freedom of expression like other human rights, however, is not absolute                        or  unbounded;  the  right  imposes  the  correlative  duty  to  exercise  it                        responsibly with due regard for the rights of others in the larger interest                        of harmony and welfare of society, and to preclude mob rule.

From 1918 to 1958, there were several transformations in the name of                        the  school  from  Indang  Farm  School  to  Indang  Rural  High  School  and                        then  to  Don  Severino  National  Agricultural  School.    The  name  Don                        Severino was in honor of the late Don Severino de las Alas who was then                        the  Interior  Secretary  of  the  Aguinaldo  Revolutionary  Government.  In                        1964,  the  school  was  converted  into  a  State  College  by  virtue  of  the                        Republic  Act  No.  3917  and  became  known  as  the  Don  Severino                        Agricultural College.                                The  conversion  of  the  school  into  a  college  paved  the  way  for                        expansion  of  its  academic  offerings.  In  response  to  the  challenges  of                        Project  CALABARZON,  schools  such  as  School  of  Arts  and  Sciences,                        School of Education and School of Engineering were created in addition                        to the school of Agriculture in 1992.                                In  1993,  in  recognition  of  its  potentials  and  achievements,  the                        college  was  designated  by  the  Department  of  Education,  Culture  and                        Sports  (DECS)  as  the  Regional  College  of  Agriculture  (RCA)  for  the                        Southern Tagalog Region.  Being the RCA, DSAC was mandated to assist                        seven  (7)  Provincial  Technical  Institutes  of  Agriculture  (PTIAs)  of  the                        region  in  the  improvement  of  their  curriculum  and  instructional                        programs,  practical  and  applied  researchers,  and  training  of  PTIA  staff                        and to lead in the production of instructional materials.  The year 1998                        stands  out  as  the  most  important  historical  milestones  of  the  school.                        DSAC  was  converted  into  the  present  Cavite  State  University  (CvSU)                        upon  passage  of  Republic  Act  No.  8468  on  January  22,  1998.    In  the                        year 2000, the University was designated by the Commission on Higher                        Education  (CHED)  as  the  Center  of  Development  for  Agriculture  and                        Agricultural  Engineering.    CHED  also  authorized  CvSU  to  be  a  CHED                        accreditor  in  accordance  with  the  Policies  and  Guidelines  on  the                        Implementation  of  the  Expanded  Tertiary  Education  Equivalency  and                        Accreditation Program (ETEEAP).                                 Presently, the University is an active host and/or sponsor of various                        regional and national research and extension programs that cater to the                        needs  of  farmers,  mentors,  entrepreneurs  and  private  as  well  as                                                                                                          243","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             244                        government personnel.  The University also exerts serious efforts towards                        streamlining its Research, Development and Extension (RD\&E) Program.                        The two major research and extension thrusts are: Coffee RD \&  E and                        Urban Agriculture RD\&E                          .                                                         INTRODUCTION                                  Research at the Cavite State University began with the conversion                        of  Indang  Rural  High  School  into  Don  Severino  Agricultural  College  in                        1964. Since then The Research Center has evolved to function as one of                        the trilogy roles of the University.  To date, the University is the seat of                        the  national  research,  development  and  extension  for  coffee–a  status                        bestowed  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture  Bureau  of  Agricultural                        Research.                               The  Research  Center  (RC)  exerted  serious  efforts  towards                        streamlining  the  Research,  Development  and  Extension  Program  by                        establishing a strong and effective research program aimed to generate                        innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers and other clienteles.                        This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their  standard  of  living.  The                        University‘s  research  program  focused  on  coffee  research,  development                        and  extension.  However,  to  accommodate  the  ever  increasing  need  for                        RD\&E activities brought about by the development of the university into                        a  comprehensive  one,  these  thrusts  have  become  more  elaborated                        through  the  ―Faculty  and  Students  Research  Capability  Enhancement                        Program‖ that has been approved by the University Board of Regents in                        2004.

Section 3.  Finance                                    1.  Sources of Funds                                            Financial  resources  are  generated  through  international                                  and  local  grants,  donations,  bilateral  agreements  and                                  collaborations  with  government  agencies,  local  and  foreign                                  funding institutions and other research agencies and councils.                                           There are two major classifications of fund sources:  the                                  internal and external funds.  The internal funds come from the                                  general  appropriation  allocation  (GAA)  of  the  Philippine                                  government.  The Center also generates funds from the Income                                  Generating Project of its various units.   On the other hand, the                                  external  funds  come  from  government  agencies  such  as  DA-                                  BAR, PCARRD, INIBAP, and STIARC as well as foreign agencies,                                  private organizations and industry partners.                                      2.  Handling of Research Funds                                            All  research  funds  are  handled  by  the  Finance                                  Management  Office  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of  the                                  Director  of  Research.    Books  of  accounts  are  kept  by  the                                  Accounting Department which is also under the supervision of                                  the Director of Administrative and Support Services.                                           Research funds that are externally funded are pooled and                                  treated  as  trust  funds.  The  Director  of  Research  exercises                                  general  control  over  all  these  research  grants.

System of Making Research and Development Plans                                       The R and E planning process may involve the following:                                     Assessment  of  environment.    Program  planning  which  is                             done  by  R  and  E  management  in  coordination  with  the  RECETS                             starts with the analysis of the factors in the environment relevant to                             the R and E programs. Environment factors refer to the set of forces                             both inside and outside the organization that affects organization‘s                             performance (Certo, 1994).  The internal environmental factors that                             can  be  considered  are  institutional  capacity,  structure,  support                             system      (financial     and     administrative)      and     organizational                             management.                                      Major consideration of the external factors can be focused on                             the  political  and  national  policies,  laws  and  procedures  of  the                             government  as  well  as  the  development  programs  of  National                             Development  Authority  (NEDA),  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),                             Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST),  Department  of                             Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  and  Commission  on                             Higher Education (CHED).                                                                                                             254","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             255                                    Setting  of  priorities.  In  setting  the  R  and  E  priorities  and                             agenda  the  institution  should  consider  its  national  and  regional                             thrusts and mandates.  It should also consider the information and                             feedback from various agencies and source such as:                                              National Agencies.  The national priorities set by the                                           various  agencies    are  usually  referred  to  and  serve  as                                           basis  for  setting  R  and  E  priorities  and  agenda  of  an                                           institution of higher learning.

Regional priorities in agriculture                                           and  natural  resources  of  the  various  agencies  in  the                                           region are also important bases in setting priorities in R                                           and E.                                            Local Government Units.           Aside from the above, the                                           institution  should  be  sensitive  to  the  priorities  set  by                                           various local government units in the province and the                                           region, in particular, and the nation in general.                                            Other    Funding  Agencies.          The  institution  should                                           also  maintain  close  collaboration with  various national                                           and  international  funding  agencies.    Through  their  R                                           and E grants, the facilities of the College/University and                                           the competence of its manpower can improved.                             Section 1.  Preparation of Research Proposal                                           The making of the research and development plans starts                                  when  the  Director  of  Research  calls  for  an  annual  research                                  proposal review.

The Technology Assessment Protocol (TAP)                                            Technology  assessment  is  an  important  aspect  of  the                                  whole technology development process.  It requires the process                                  of anticipation and analysis of a broad range of socio-cultural,                                  technical,  economic,  environmental  and  political/legal  impact                                  prior to the introduction of a given technology or even while a                                  specific  technology  is  being  promoted.    The  success  of  the                                  technology  assessment  depends  on  the  efficient  gathering  and                                  synthesis  of  adequate  information.    The  TAP,  which  was                                  developed  by  PCARRD  in  2000,  embodies  some  recent                                  innovations  in  technology  assessment  procedures  and                                  processes.    The  processes  are  facilitated  by  the  use  of  a  gap                                  identification tool called Quick Resources Appraisal (QRA), and                                  an  intervention  identification  tool  -  the  Risk  Management                                  Process (RMP).  The TAP aims to increase the level of confidence                                  of the R \& D community on the technologies it will promote and                                  transfer.                                           A  pre-requisite  to  the  application  of  TAP  is  the                                  organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at  least                                  five  (5)  members  with  two  basic  expertise  that  are  critically                                  needed:    a  technically  competent  expert  who  knows  the                                  technology  and  the  commodity  being  assessed  and  an                                  economist with capabilities in financial analysis.

Mechanics of Implementation                         1. The workload system applies to all faculty members who are involved                           in R \& E activities either full-time or part-time.                         2.  For  purposes  of  workload  credit,  the  assigned  task  external  to  the                           university shall be covered by a Memorandum of Agreement between                           the  University  and  the  partner  Agency  or  a  Special  Order  from  the                           office of the University President.                         3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R \& E to                           be classified full-time researcher/extensions.                         4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R \&                           E  only  if  he/she  has  satisfied  the  minimum  workload  of  18  credit                           units in teaching and R \& E work.                         5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the                           same program  shall only be credited once whichever has the higher                           credit units.                         6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit                           units is beyond 25 units                          7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R\&E  and  has  received                           honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units                         8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.                         9.  Credit  units  as  researcher/extensions  shall  only  be  claimed  for  the                           period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.                          10. Workload accreditation of other R\&E activities not covered by these                             guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for                             Research  \&  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the  approval  of  the                             President.                          11.  The  rate  of  overload  pay  or  honorarium  is  similar  to  those  on  full                             time    teaching.                                                                                                            267","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             268                        12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R \& E allocation  or                             from other sources which the University deems appropriate.                            Honorarium                                    Honorarium  is  a  form  of  remuneration  granted  to  researchers                           for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is a                           form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees  on                           special  assignment.      For  this  purpose,  a  special  assignment  is  an                           undertaking       by    an    individual     or    a    composite      group     of                           officials/employees,  which  is  beyond  their  regular  and  primary                           functions.

However, the Special                           Budget Officer of the Research Center records every disbursement for                           each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the  Purchase  Request                           Forms  to  indicate  availability  of  funds  and  from  which  funds  the                           purchases are to be credited.                                    The Office of the Director of Research serves as the monitoring                           and coordinating arm for all researches in the University.  Although                           research  activities  are  independently  undertaken  by  the  different                           colleges,  faculty  researchers  are  still  required  to  submit  quarterly                           progress reports on their research projects/studies.  The researchers                           submit  their  progress  reports  to  their  respective  Deans  concerned,                           which  in  turn  endorses  the  progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the                           Director.  This enables the Research Center to keep track of ongoing                           projects  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  workload                           compensation purposes.                                The technical reports are submitted by the project proponent to the                           Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Research Center.  The numbers                           of copies are stated below:                                   Copies of Progress Report to be forwarded to the funding agency                                 Copies  of  the  Annual  Report  to  be  used  in  annual  agency  in-                                  house review                                 Copies of the Terminal Report to be submitted two months after                                  the termination or completion of the project.

The  AACCUP  guidelines  in  accrediting  academic  programs  of  colleges  and                    universities  also  look  at  the  kind  of  research  outputs  the  colleges  are                    producing during the time of evaluation.                      Faculty members who serve as thesis advisers have no continuing research                    project(s) in spite their potential in proposing and implementing researches                    along their fields of specialization and experiences.                      Thesis in the graduate and undergraduate levels as well as in the laboratory                    school are expensive and need some forms of financial support in pursuing                    student‘s researches with improved quality of output.                      Faculty  research  project  may  also  accommodate  and  fund  thesis  of                    students.                      Students and faculty members need to expose and be more confident and in                    coming up with quality of outputs.                     There  is  need  for  the  colleges  to  identify  workable  and  doable  research                    thrust,  agenda  and  program  that  will  serve  as  guide  in  implementing  the                    research activities of the university.                                                                                                              316","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             317                    For these activities, the university has a starting capital of one million pesos                    for the research project of the colleges.                                                             ___________________________                      1   Prepared  and  submitted  by  SIMEON  S.

Rationale                            Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property                    Code of the Philippines, states that:                             ―The  State  recognizes  that  an  effective  intellectual  and  industrial                    property system is vital to the development of domestic and creative activity,                    facilitates transfers of technology, attracts foreign investments, and ensures                    market access for our products.   It shall protect and secure the exclusive                    rights  of  scientist,  inventors,  artists  and  other  gifted  citizens  to  their                    intellectual  property  and  creations,  particularly  when  beneficial  to  the                    people.‖                             With  the  various  intellectual  properties  (IP‘s)  developed  in  the                    university such as the Aguinaldo Blend Coffee, processed products, design                    for  biogas  digester  and  innumerable  research  outputs  being  presented  for                    public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire  protection.  The                    biogas  digester  was  just  recently  granted  a  patent,  while  research                    outputs/publications  have  been  presented  without  copyright  protection,                    except  for  some  that  were  able  to  acquire  ISBN  registration  from  the                    National  Library.  Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a  system  for                    protecting economically viable intellectual properties to maximize gains that                    could finance more researches in the future.
