From 1918 to 1958, there were several transformations in the                        name of the school from IndangFarmSchool to IndangRuralHigh School                        and  then  to  DonSeverinoNationalAgriculturalSchool.    The  name  Don                        Severino was in honor of the late Don Severino de las Alas who was then                        the  Interior  Secretary  of  the  Aguinaldo  Revolutionary  Government.  In                        1964,  the  school  was  converted  into  a  State  College  by  virtue  of  the                        Republic      Act     No.      3917      and      became       known       as     the                        DonSeverinoAgriculturalCollege.                               The  conversion  of  the  school  into  a  college  paved  the  way  for                        expansion  of  its  academic  offerings.  In  response  to  the  challenges  of                        Project  CALABARZON,  schools  such  as  School  of  Arts  and  Sciences,                        School of Education and School of Engineering were created in addition                        to the school of Agriculture in 1992.                                In  1993,  in  recognition  of  its  potentials  and  achievements,  the                        college  was  designated  by  the  Department  of  Education,  Culture  and                        Sports  (DECS)  as  the  Regional  College  of  Agriculture  (RCA)  for  the                        Southern Tagalog Region.  Being the RCA, DSAC was mandated to assist                        seven  (7)  Provincial  Technical  Institutes  of  Agriculture  (PTIAs)  of  the                        region  in  the  improvement  of  their  curriculum  and  instructional                        programs,  practical  and  applied  researchers,  and  training  of  PTIA  staff                        and to lead in the production of instructional materials.  The year 1998                        stands  out  as  the  most  important  historical  milestones  of  the  school.                        DSAC was converted into the present CaviteStateUniversity (CvSU) upon                        passage  of  Republic  Act  No.  8468  on  January  22,  1998.    In  the  year                        2000,  the  University  was  designated  by  the  Commission  on  Higher                        Education  (CHED)  as  the  Center  of  Development  for  Agriculture  and                        Agricultural  Engineering.    CHED  also  authorized  CvSU  to  be  a  CHED                        accreditor  in  accordance  with  the  Policies  and  Guidelines  on  the                        Implementation  of  the  Expanded  Tertiary  Education  Equivalency  and                        Accreditation Program (ETEEAP).                                  Presently, the University is an active host and/or sponsor of various                        regional and national research and extension programs that cater to the                        needs  of  farmers,  mentors,  entrepreneurs  and  private  as  well  as                                                                                                          243","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             244                        government personnel.  The University also exerts serious efforts towards                        streamlining its Research, Development and Extension (RD\&E) Program.                        The two major research and extension thrusts are: Coffee RD \& E and                        Urban Agriculture RD\&E                          .                                                         INTRODUCTION                                  Research at the CaviteStateUniversity began with the conversion of                        IndangRuralHigh  School  into  DonSeverinoAgriculturalCollege  in  1964.                        Since  then  The  Research  Center  has  evolved  to  function  as  one  of  the                        trilogy roles of the University.  To date, the University is the seat of the                        national  research,  development  and  extension  for  coffee–a  status                        bestowed  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture  Bureau  of  Agricultural                        Research.                               The  Research  Center  (RC)  exerted  serious  efforts  towards                        streamlining  the  Research,  Development  and  Extension  Program  by                        establishing a strong and effective research program aimed to generate                        innovative and viable technologies useful to farmers and other clienteles.                        This  is  done  with  the  goal  of  improving  their  standard  of  living.  The                        University’s  research  program  focused  on  coffee  research,  development                        and  extension.  However,  to  accommodate  the  ever  increasing  need  for                        RD\&E activities brought about by the development of the university into                        a  comprehensive  one,  these  thrusts  have  become  more  elaborated                        through  the  “Faculty  and  Students  Research  Capability  Enhancement                        Program” that has been approved by the University Board of Regents in                        2004.                                    The  university  has  maintained  ties  and  established  collaborative                        projects  with  international  and  local  agencies  with  emphasis  on                        plantation  crops,  high  value  fruits  and  vegetables,  ornamentals,  herbs                        and spices and poultry and livestock among others.                                                                                                                         244","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             245                       Article 1.

Facilities                                   The Center provides support for the faculty researchers in terms                           of  its  major  research  facilities  and  laboratories.    The  Central                           Experiment Station is the biggest facility of the ResearchCenter which                           comprised of four (4) ha.  It houses the coffee germplasm collection,                           coffee  processing  unit,  coffee  nursery,  automated  greenhouses,  and                           net houses.  It also serves as an experimental site for various research                                                                                                          252","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             253                           projects and field laboratories.

Section 3.  Finance                                    1.  Sources of Funds                                            Financial  resources  are  generated  through  international                                  and  local  grants,  donations,  bilateral  agreements  and                                  collaborations  with  government  agencies,  local  and  foreign                                  funding institutions and other research agencies and councils.                                           There are two major classifications of fund sources:  the                                  internal and external funds.  The internal funds come from the                                  general  appropriation  allocation  (GAA)  of  the  Philippine                                  government.  The Center also generates funds from the Income                                  Generating Project of its various units.   On the other hand, the                                  external  funds  come  from  government  agencies  such  as  DA-                                  BAR, PCARRD, INIBAP, and STIARC as well as foreign agencies,                                  private organizations and industry partners.                                      2.  Handling of Research Funds                                            All  research  funds  are  handled  by  the  Finance                                  Management  Office  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of  the                                  Director  of  Research.    Books  of  accounts  are  kept  by  the                                  Accounting Department which is also under the supervision of                                  the Director of Administrative and Support Services.                                           Research funds that are externally funded are pooled and                                  treated  as  trust  funds.  The  Director  of  Research  exercises                                  general  control  over  all  these  research  grants.    These  are                                  deposited  in  the  bank  as  trust  fund  lumped  together  to  earn                                  interest.  Funds are released to the Accounting Office by project                                  allotments.  The project/study leaders handle all the processing                                  of  papers  to  release  the  fund  meant  for  their  research                                  projects/studies.    Fund  from  income  generating  projects  are                                  also being handle by the Accounting Division with full control of                                  the Research Director.                                                                                                               253","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             254                                   3.  Control of Research Fund                                           Research funds will be reported in terms of obligation or                                  liquidation.  The Accounting Department controls expenditures                                  in accordance with the items in the budget and sub-allotment.                                  Payrolls, vouchers, request for supplies and materials and other                                  obligation  of  the  projects  will  be  paid  through  the  Accounting                                  Department with  approval  from  the  Director  of  Support                                  Services/President depending upon the amount.

System of Making Research and Development Plans                                       The R and E planning process may involve the following:                                     Assessment  of  environment.    Program  planning  which  is                             done  by  R  and  E  management  in  coordination  with  the  RECETS                             starts with the analysis of the factors in the environment relevant to                             the R and E programs. Environment factors refer to the set of forces                             both inside and outside the organization that affects organization’s                             performance (Certo, 1994).  The internal environmental factors that                             can  be  considered  are  institutional  capacity,  structure,  support                             system      (financial     and     administrative)      and     organizational                             management.                                     Major consideration of the external factors can be focused on                             the  political  and  national  policies,  laws  and  procedures  of  the                             government  as  well  as  the  development  programs  of  National                             Development  Authority  (NEDA),  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),                             Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST),  Department  of                             Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  and  Commission  on                             Higher Education (CHED).                                                                                                             254","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             255                                    Setting  of  priorities.  In  setting  the  R  and  E  priorities  and                             agenda  the  institution  should  consider  its  national  and  regional                             thrusts and mandates.  It should also consider the information and                             feedback from various agencies and source such as:                                            National  Agencies.

The Technology Assessment Protocol (TAP)                                            Technology  assessment  is  an  important  aspect  of  the                                  whole technology development process.  It requires the process                                  of anticipation and analysis of a broad range of socio-cultural,                                  technical,  economic,  environmental  and  political/legal  impact                                  prior to the introduction of a given technology or even while a                                  specific  technology  is  being  promoted.    The  success  of  the                                  technology  assessment  depends  on  the  efficient  gathering  and                                  synthesis  of  adequate  information.    The  TAP,  which  was                                  developed  by  PCARRD  in  2000,  embodies  some  recent                                  innovations  in  technology  assessment  procedures  and                                  processes.    The  processes  are  facilitated  by  the  use  of  a  gap                                  identification tool called Quick Resources Appraisal (QRA), and                                  an  intervention  identification  tool  -  the  Risk  Management                                  Process (RMP).  The TAP aims to increase the level of confidence                                  of the R \& D community on the technologies it will promote and                                  transfer.                                           A  pre-requisite  to  the  application  of  TAP  is  the                                  organization  of  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  at  least                                  five  (5)  members  with  two  basic  expertise  that  are  critically                                  needed:    a  technically  competent  expert  who  knows  the                                  technology  and  the  commodity  being  assessed  and  an                                  economist with capabilities in financial analysis.

Mechanics of Implementation                         1. The workload system applies to all faculty members who are involved                           in R \& E activities either full-time or part-time.                         2.  For  purposes  of  workload  credit,  the  assigned  task  external  to  the                           university shall be covered by a Memorandum of Agreement between                           the  University  and  the  partner  Agency  or  a  Special  Order  from  the                           office of the University President.                         3.  A faculty member shall have a minimum of 18 credit units in R \& E to                           be classified full-time researcher/extensions.                         4.  A full-time faculty member shall be entitled to workload credit in R \&                           E  only  if  he/she  has  satisfied  the  minimum  workload  of  18  credit                           units in teaching and R \& E work.                          5.  A program leader who is a project leader and a study leader in the                           same program shall only be credited once whichever has the higher                           credit units.                         6. Overload pay shall be given to faculty researchers whose total credit                           units is beyond 25 units                          7.  Faculty  member  with  external  activity  to  R\&E  and  has  received                           honorarium for such activity shall not be given credit units                         8.  All claims for credit units shall be supported by proper documents.                         9.  Credit  units  as  researcher/extensions  shall  only  be  claimed  for  the                           period specified in the program/project study activity as approved.                          10. Workload accreditation of other R\&E activities not covered by these                             guidelines  shall  be  referred  to  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for                             Research  \&  Extension  for  consideration  upon  the  approval  of  the                             President.                          11.  The  rate  of  overload  pay  or  honorarium  is  similar  to  those  on  full                             time    teaching.                                                                                                            267","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             268                        12. The funds for the overload shall come from the R \& E allocation or                             from other sources which the University deems appropriate.                            Honorarium                                    Honorarium  is  a  form  of  remuneration  granted  to  researchers                           for services rendered beyond the minimum/regular workload.  It is a                           form  of  incentive  granted  for  the  services  of  officials/employees  on                           special  assignment.      For  this  purpose,  a  special  assignment  is  an                           undertaking       by    an    individual     or    a    composite      group     of                           officials/employees,  which  is  beyond  their  regular  and  primary                           functions.

Those  paid  to  a  government  official  or  employee  or  private                           individual      who     is    involved     in    the     conceptualization       of                           projects/programs;  implementation  of  research  and  development                           activities;  coordination  of  R  \&  D  activities;  or  rendition  of  advisory;                           administrative, and/or management functions in the implementation                           of R \& D ( UPLB Research Manual, 2002).                                                                                                                    268","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             269                           Monitoring and evaluation                            Research Projects                                    The  research  projects  are  monitored  in  two  ways:  (1)  the                           financial and (2) the technical aspects.                                   The  accounting  department  of  the  University  monitors  and                           audits the financial status of the research funds. However, the Special                           Budget Officer of the ResearchCenter records every disbursement for                           each  research  project/unit  and  annotates  the  Purchase  Request                           Forms  to  indicate  availability  of  funds  and  from  which  funds  the                           purchases are to be credited.                                    The Office of the Director of Research serves as the monitoring                           and coordinating arm for all researches in the University.  Although                           research  activities  are  independently  undertaken  by  the  different                           colleges,  faculty  researchers  are  still  required  to  submit  quarterly                           progress reports on their research projects/studies.  The researchers                           submit  their  progress  reports  to  their  respective  Deans  concerned,                           which  in  turn  endorses  the  progress  reports  to  the  Office  of  the                           Director.  This  enables  the  ResearchCenter  to  keep  track  of  ongoing                           projects  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  workload                           compensation purposes.                                The technical reports are submitted by the project proponent to the                           Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the ResearchCenter.  The numbers                           of copies are stated below:                                   Copies of Progress Report to be forwarded to the funding agency                                 Copies  of  the  Annual  Report  to  be  used  in  annual  agency  in-                                  house review                                 Copies of the Terminal Report to be submitted two months after                                  the termination or completion of the project.                            Annual Local Agency In-House Review                                    One  major  activity  to  facilitate  the  monitoring  and  evaluation                           purposes is the holding of the Annual Local Agency In-house Review.                           It involves the evaluation of all researches that are either completed or                           ongoing  during  the  particular  year  under  review.  During  these                           reviews,  researchers  present  the  progress/highlights  of  their                           researches.

The  AACCUP  guidelines  in  accrediting  academic  programs  of  colleges  and                    universities  also  look  at  the  kind  of  research  outputs  the  colleges  are                    producing during the time of evaluation.                      Faculty members who serve as thesis advisers have no continuing research                    project(s) in spite their potential in proposing and implementing researches                    along their fields of specialization and experiences.                      Thesis in the graduate and undergraduate levels as well as in the laboratory                    school are expensive and need some forms of financial support in pursuing                    student’s researches with improved quality of output.                      Faculty  research  project  may  also  accommodate  and  fund  thesis  of                    students.                      Students and faculty members need to expose and be more confident and in                    coming up with quality of outputs.                     There  is  need  for  the  colleges  to  identify  workable  and  doable  research                    thrust,  agenda  and  program  that  will  serve  as  guide  in  implementing  the                    research activities of the university.                                                                                                              316","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             317                    For these activities, the university has a starting capital of one million pesos                    for the research project of the colleges.                                                             ___________________________                      1   Prepared  and  submitted  by  SIMEON  S.

It shall protect and secure the exclusive                    rights  of  scientist,  inventors,  artists  and  other  gifted  citizens  to  their                    intellectual  property  and  creations,  particularly  when  beneficial  to  the                    people.”                             With  the  various  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  developed  in  the                    university such as the Aguinaldo Blend Coffee, processed products, design                    for  biogas  digester  and  innumerable  research  outputs  being  presented  for                    public  consumption,  a  few  of  them  were  able  to  acquire  protection.  The                    biogas  digester  was  just  recently  granted  a  patent,  while  research                    outputs/publications  have  been  presented  without  copyright  protection,                    except  for  some  that  were  able  to  acquire  ISBN  registration  from  the                    National  Library.  Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a  system  for                    protecting economically viable intellectual properties to maximize gains that                    could finance more researches in the future.

III. Objective                             To  establish  a  system  protecting  the  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  or                    results/products generated through researches conducted in the university.                     IV. Strategy                            The University shall establish an IPR Office that covers all intellectual                    property protection activities and provide trainings/seminars to researchers                    to  increase  awareness  on  IPR.  The  IPR  Office  will  be  divided  in  to  two                    sections, each having IPR Assistants, one for patentable IP’s and the other                    for publishable IP’s.                            The  IPR  Officer  will  work  under  the  Office  of  the  Vice-President  for                    Research,  Extension,  Continuing  Education  and  Training  Services                     1 Section 4, R.A. 8293 (1998); TRIPS.                    2 Section 21, R.A. 8293 (1998).                                                                                                          325","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________                                                                                                             326                    (RECETS), and is tasked to identify, protect and exploit commercially on the                    University’s  behalf  the  intellectual  property  rights  generated  by  the                    University’s researchers.                             The  IPR  Officer  will  be  involved  in  identifying  and  protecting  the                    University’s  intellectual  property  rights,  and  in  conforming  to  existing                    systems  in  managing,  recording  and  tracking  the  progress  of  intellectual                    property applications and commercialization of the property.

In  this  capacity  the  IPR                    Assistants will be responsible for applying for and liquidating cash advances                    accrued during the applications and payment of other fees pertinent to the                    application. Where necessary the IPR Officer will work with the University’s                    legal advisers.                            The IPR Officer and IPR Assistants will be provided with appropriate                    external training to ensure that they can become competent in all aspects of                    the role.                     Other responsibilities include the following:                             Formulate,  propose  and  implement  governing  guidelines  in                    patenting/copyrighting research results in the University                            Deal  with  agencies  requesting  for  commercialization  rights  for                    patented/  copyrighted  materials  from  the  university,  enter  into  licensing                    agreements and manage the payment of royalties.
