When  .this                        was  converted  into  Don  Severino  Agricultural  College  (DSAC)  in  1964,                        extension became one of the functions of this institution, in addition to                        instruction  and  research.    DSAC  started  with  two  major  units,  the                        Secondary  Department  and  the  College  Department.  The  latter                        conducted extension services in the form of seminars on improved farm                        practices and certified seeds and veterinary services to the animals of the                        service  area.    In  addition,  the  College  maintained  a  one-and-a-half                        hectare  nursery  for  the  propagation  of  and  multiplication  of  important                        plants for on-campus and for farmers‟ use.  The Swine Project which was                        used for instruction purposes also served as source of foundation stock                        for farmers.  Boar services were made available to small hog raisers for                        the improvement of their stock (DSAC Annual Report, SY 1968-69).                                Since then, the milestones of extension services were recorded in                        the Annual Reports of this educational institution.                                                                                                                       1","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ________________________________________________________________________  2                       Article 1.

UGNAYAN: A Unified Community-Based Project                            Section  1.Ugnayan  is  a  Tagalog  word  which  connotes  linkages  and                                  coordination among the stakeholders.    The University selected                                  an UGNAYAN barangay or village where the extension services                                  of the different colleges are focused.                                          UGNAYAN  is  a  unified  extension  and  research  program                                  for the academic units of Cavite State University.  Ugnayan is a                                  Tagalog  word  which  connotes  coordination  and  cooperation.                                  While this program was approved by the Board of Regents (BOR                                  No. 55) on 6 December 2001, the practice dates back in the late                                  70‟s as Project       UGNAYAN.                                           Originally, its philosophy stated that “it is an approach to                                  rural development where the spirit of coordination among those                                  concerned  in  the  upliftment  of  a  community  is  given                                  importance.           From a singly focused agricultural extension                                  project,  the  project  evolved  into  a  unified  extension  and                                  research program.                                           This  approach  allows  each  major  academic  unit  of  the                                  University  to  pursue  community  service  projects  and  applied                                  research in a beneficiary barangay that is adopted as pilot area                                  by the University.  The problem to be solved should be within                                  the  area  expertise  of  the  College  concerned.    Each  College                                  establishes  its  own  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  with  a                                  Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU) at the office of the                                  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs  and  coordinated  by  OVP                                  RECETS.

The  extension  program  support  the  Millennium                           Development  Goals  (MDGs)  of  the  United  Nations,  the  national,                           regional, provincial and local development plans.                         b)  Colleges  and  branch  campuses  plan  and  implement  their  respective                           extension  programs  in  coordination  with  the  University  Extension                           Services.    The  process  is  participatory  involving  the  stakeholders                           which  include  the  target  clients,  the  students,  alumni,  faculty                           members,  representatives  of  government  and  non-government                           agencies and other concerned individuals.  The needs and concerns of                           these     stakeholders      are     considered      in   the     planning      and                           implementation of the extension programs.                                                                                                               22","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          23                         c)  The  different  colleges/branch  campuses  and  the  Extension  Services                           apply the different strategies for identifying the needs.  These include                           survey,  focus  group  interviews,  experts‟  contributions,  direct                           participation of the target clients in the planning process, and the use                           of secondary data.                         d)  Decentralization of the planning process shall start at the department                           level.    The  colleges  integrate  all  the  planned  extension  programs  of                           their  respective  departments  into  one  Research,  Development  and                           Extension Agenda and Programs (RDEAP).  There is a designated RD                           and E coordinator at the department level (depending on the size of                           the  department)  and  at  the  college  level.    The  college  RD  and  E                           Coordinator  under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  Dean  consolidates                           and prepares the RDEAP.

The university Research Development and Extension office conducts                           planning  workshop.    Headed  by  the  Vice  President,  The  RDE                           spearheads  the  formulation  of  the  RDEAP  through  a  workshop.                           Participants in this planning workshop are the Deans of the different                           Colleges  and  branch  campuses  together  with  their  respective                           Research, Development and Extension (RDE) Coordinators.                         b.  During the University planning workshop the thrusts of the University                           are reviewed and revised.  In this process, identification and selection                           of research and extension thrusts are guided by the stated vision and                           mission of the university/college/campus.  Likewise, the Millennium                           Development  Goals  (MDGs),  national  and  provincial,  municipal  and                           local  development goals are considered.                         c.  The  research,  development  and  extension  (RDE)  thrusts  resulting                           from  the  latest  (2004)  RDEAP  planning  workshops  include:  poverty                           alleviation,  food  security,  primary  health  care  and  public  health,                           alternative   medicine,  cultural  heritage  preservation,  ecosystem                           management,  energy  conservation  and  utilization,  institutional                           capability  building,  information  and  communication  technology,                           infrastructure  planning  and  design,  bio-technology,  industrial                           technology,  pedagogy/andragogy,  gender  and  development,  coffee,                           pineapple, banana, kaong, makapuno,                herbs        and        spices,                           ornamentals, and urban agriculture.                                                                                                            23","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          24                            Section 3.  Presentation of RDEAP by College                         a.  Prior  to  the  actual  conduct  of  RDEAP  planning  workshop,  the  RDE                           Coordinators present their draft plans with their respective Deans for                           further  comments  and  suggestions.  During  the  workshop,  the  RDE                           Coordinators polish their prepared Agenda.  As part of the workshop,                           the  RDEAP  of  the  different  Colleges/Campuses  are  presented  to  the                           RECETS Council for comments and suggestions.                                   Also, during the presentation of various agenda and programs                           by  College/Campus,  duplication  of  plans  and  programs  are                           eliminated.  In cases where similar areas of concerns are presented by                           two  or  more  Colleges,  either  one  party  will  drop  its  proposed                           knowledge  area  or  integrate  such  with  the  others  of  similar  nature.                           Also, group members openly discuss and decide as to who would lead                           the implementation of such programs.                         b.

Office of the Director for Extension calls                           for the submission of an extension proposal. Although the extension                           has its own format, format shall be based on the requirement of the                           funding  agency  and  in  case  that  the  fund  shall  come  from  the                           university, the proposal should follow the extension format.                           College/Campuses prepare capsule proposals.  Faculty members of                           the  different  colleges  with  varied  fields  of  specialization  prepare                           capsule  proposal  on  their  areas  of  expertise  and  interest.    The                           proposal  maybe  singly  prepared  or  in  cooperation  (interdisciplinary                           approach) with other extensionists.  The proposals are in line with the                           approved RDEAP.  Capsule proposals are reviewed at the department                           level  to  the  college  levels  by  the  respective  research  and  extension                           committee in coordination with RDE Coordinator.                           Deans  endorse  capsule  proposals  to  URDE  Council  through  the                           Extension  Director.    The  reviewed  proposals  are  then  endorsed  to                           the URDEC through the Director for approval.                           URDEC  reviews  and  approves  the  capsule  proposals.

Proposals  requiring  bigger  funding  are  usually                           submitted to external funding institution while the remaining projects                           are recommended for local funding.                           Extension  Director  prepares  work  and  financial  plans  for                           approved projects.  Extension Director considers the newly approved                           proposals in the preparation of their annual work and financial plan.                             Section 5.   Implementation of Approved Projects                               a.)  Proponents  implement  their  approved  projects  following                               their      scheduled activities. Program/project leaders implement                               their      approved  projects  at  their  respective  colleges/campuses                               in  coordination with RECETS.  While the University has RECETS                               that is   in-charge  of  the  research  and  extension  functions,  the                               planning and   implementation of research and extension projects                               is  decentralized  but  unified  up  to  the  department  level.    This                               approach has been   institutionalized  and  exemplified  in  CvSU                               through the concept called UGNAYAN.                                                                                                             25","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          26                     Article 11.

Monitoring  looks  at  both                           programmed  processes  and  changes  in  conditions  of  target  groups                           and   institutions  brought  about  by  programmed  activities.    It  also                           identifies   strengths  and  weaknesses  in  a  programmed.  The                           performance  information  generated  from  monitoring  enhances                           learning      from     experience       and     improves       decision-making.                           Management and  programmed              implementers        typically     conduct                           monitoring.                                   Evaluation  is  a  periodic,  in-depth  analysis  of  programmed                           performance. In relies on data generated through monitoring activities                           as  well  as  information  obtained  from  other  sources  (e.g.,  studies,                           research, in-depth           interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  surveys                           etc.). Evaluations are often        (but  not  always)  conducted  with  the                           assistance of external evaluators (UNFPA, 2004).                            Section 1.

Meetings – Dean or Director conducts regular meetings with their                                  unit  heads  and/or  staff  to  monitor  the  planned  and  on-going                                  activities including that of extension matters.                                   The Director of Extension services coordinates and monitors the                           extension  activities  of  the  different  colleges  primarily  through                           meetings with the different Research, Development and Extension (RD                           E) Coordinators.                            5. Field Visits – All faculty members and staff engaged in extension                                  activities are conducting regular field‟s visits to their respective                                  service areas.  In the UGNAYAN service area of the CvSU main                                  campus,  the  RD  and  E  Coordinators  either  go  in  group  or                                  individually.                            6.  Accomplishment  Reports  –  The  Extension  Services  regularly                                  submits  monthly, weekly and daily accomplishment reports to                                  the  concerned  offices.    At  the  end  of  the  year,  a  Performance                                  Accomplishment Report (PAR) is submitted to the Office of the                                  President through the RECETS office.  This PAR compares the                                  year accomplishments vis-à-vis targeted activities.                            7.  Telephone calls  – The presence of modern technologies like the                                  cell   phones  make  it  easy  to  contact  and  collect  information                                  and   updates       from     RD     and     E    Coordinators,      faculty                                  extentionists and  clients.                                                                                                            28","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          29                             8.  Memorandum  and  Other  Written  Communication  –  The                                  Conventional  methods  of  monitoring  projects  are  through                                  memoranda and other written communication, e.g. letters.                                   a. Monitoring Reports and Other Forms                                   To effectively monitor planned and on-going extension projects                           and  resources  of  Extension  Services,  the  following  forms  shall  be                           used:                                     Daily Performance Report                                    Activities/Projects Progress Report (Weekly/Monthly)                                    Monthly Expenditure and Income of Projects/Services                                    Student Loan Fund                                    Loan and Payment Status (Semestral)                                    Form  to  Monitor  Number  of  Visitors  Served  and                                      Accommodated                            Section 2.   Evaluation Strategies                            a.)    Mechanisms and Processes                                   The  University  has  established  mechanisms  and  processes  by                                  which  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  extension  services                                  and resources are ensured.  As mentioned earlier, these include                                  designation  of  RDE  Council  and  RDE  Coordinators;  and  the                                  conduct of yearly in-house review.                                           The  Extension  Services  has  just  introduced  the  logical                                  framework   approach  (LFA)  or  concept  in  the  evaluation  of                                  extension  programs  and  projects.    It  has  adopted  the  use  of                                  Logical  Framework  Model  (Appendix  2)  in  the  presentation  of                                  papers  during  the  In-House  Review.    This  model  is  able  to                                  represent the different types of evaluation.                            b.)    Types of Evaluation                                           There  are  different  kinds  of  approaches  to  evaluation,                                  based on when it occurs (process vs. outcome), the intentions of                                  the  evaluator  (formative  vs.  summative),  and  who  does  the                                  evaluation (internal vs. external).                                           Evaluations maybe conducted at any of several phases of                                  program development and implementation.Process and outcome                                  evaluations relate to the phase of the program studied.  Process                                                                                                            29","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          30                                           evaluations  examine  what  goes  on  inside  the  program                                  while  it  is  in  progress,  focusing  on  such  things  as  activities                                  offered, staff        practices,  and  client  actions.    Evaluating                                  program processes may  be  very  helpful  in  understanding  why                                  program  objectives  are  or  are  not  met.    Outcome  evaluations                                  put  emphasis  on  the  program  objectives  or  outcomes:  what                                  happens  to  clients  as  a  result  of  their  participation  in  the                                  program. The processes and outcome evaluations may either be                                  formative  or  summative,  depending  on  the  intentions  of  the                                  evaluator (or those who hire the evaluator).                                           Program  sponsors  and  taxpayers  typically  are  interested                                  in  program  accountability,  which  calls  for  summative                                  evaluation.    Summative  evaluation  helps  to  answer  the                                  question,  “Is  the  program  earning  its  keep?”  and  provides                                  information which can be used to help program sponsors make                                  informed  decisions  about  program  funding.    In  comparison,  a                                  person  who  implement  programs  are  often  more  interested  in                                  learning how to improve their programs. Program improvement                                  is the purpose of formative evaluation.  When an organization                                  has  an  evaluator or  evaluation  team  on  staff to  evaluate  their                                  own programs, this is considered            internal           evaluation.                                  External  evaluations  are  conducted  by  outside  by  outside                                  evaluation organizations or independent evaluators (PREL).

It is mandated to generate                                  income.  The  idea  is  for  the  University  to  augment  whatever                                  subsidy  is  cut  by  the  government  from  their  regular                                  appropriations,  particularly  on  Maintenance  and  Other                                  Operating Expenses (MOOE), a cost cutting measure adopted by                                  the government at the onset of the economic crisis in 1999.                                  While OBA has been into business from the time it was put up                                  as  Office  of  Farm  Business  Operation  (OFBO)  in  the  80‟s  and                                  subsequently  Office  of  Business  Operation  (OBO)  in  1992,  it                                  has not yet reached the point where it had helped the University                                  in  augmenting  its  funds  for  the  MOOE.  Nevertheless  knowing                                  that  not  much  financial  support  from  the  government  is                                  forthcoming, OBA continues to expand its  business  operations                                  under the umbrella of E \& BA.                                  The  Office,  however,  has  so  far  demonstrated  its  ability  to                                  provide  employment  to  45  workers  who  are  paid  a  lot  higher                                  than  those  in  similar  private  businesses  like  piggeries  and                                  poultry farms. It also partially supports the two other units of E                                  \&       BA,  namely:  the  Office  of  Alumni  Affairs  (AA)  and  the                                  Public  Information  and  Community  Relations  Office  (PICRO).                                  Likewise, the workers in the Crop Production Project are highly                                  subsidized  by  the  Office  because  their  main  assignment  is  to                                  maintain  the  marginal  areas  of  the  University,  and  to  raise                                  income is only secondary.                                  Given  this  scenario,  the  Office  of  Business  Affairs  is                                  continuously  reinventing  itself  in  order  to  respond  to  its                                  mandate.                                                                                                                     36","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          37                        Importance and Role of Income Generating Projects (IGPs) in CvSU                                The primary reason for the establishment of IGPs in CvSU can be                           summarized as follows:                                  IGPs  strengthen  the  instruction,  research  and  extension                                  functions  of  the  University  as  they  provide  facilities  and                                  technologies  necessary  for  the  hands-on  experiences  of  the                                  students, extension workers, entrepreneurs, and farmers. The -                                  project  serves  as  “silent  salesman”  of  the  institution  and  a                                  powerful tool in disseminating information.                                  IGPs  generate  additional  income  for  the  University  so  it  can                                  attain flexibility in financial management.                                  IGPs provide venues for students, faculty and staff members to                                  hone their business acumen.                                  IGPs  provide  model  projects  that  student  may  replicate  after                                  graduation.

Weanling Production – This in itself is profitable enough and                                  does not require the business to invest on so many feeds. The                                  piglet is raised to a maximum of 70 days in the farm and sold                                  according to the prevailing market price.                            b.)    Fattener  Production  –  This  means  additional  on  feeds  and                                  fluctuation in fattener price is a risk that the management has                                  to take.

Food Processing (Coffee, Fruits and Vegetables)                                        Since  most  farm  products  are  perishable  by  nature,  it  is                                 necessary       that  processing  be  integrated  into  production.                                 Fruits, meat products,        milk  that  are  not  sold  because  of                                 oversupply should be processed and   in  that  way  can  be  stored                                 for longer period.

Printing Services Unit (PSU).                                  The PSU is the official printing unit of the University. It prints                           all papers and documents for all colleges and offices of the University.                           A  system  of  transfer  of  funds  from  other  units  of  the  University  or                           direct payment through voucher is being   practiced  for  this  purpose.                           The idea is to centralize all printing jobs within the University so as to                           avoid  job  commissions  to  private  entities.  Through  this  system,  the                           University   saves a lot of money and at the same time OBA earns a                                  sizeable income.                                  An assistant unit head and two (2) printing technicians manage                           the printing office.                                   E.      Postal Service                                   The University operates a Post Office which is mainly   service                         oriented and does not contribute much to the earnings   of OBA.

House  parents  are                               employed in the dormitory to provide guidance and counseling to                               the occupants as well as to do the housekeeping chores. University                               visitors and transients are accommodated on a per day basis.                                      During  vacation,  the  dormitory  accommodates  retreats  and                               religious  activities  to  maximize  the  earning  potential  of  the                               dormitory.

Section 1.  Financial Management Guidelines                                  Initial capitalization is taken from the General Fund (Fund 101).                                 Income is generated by the projects.                                 Each project has its own account code at the Accounting Office.                                 Funds  for  a  particular  project  cannot  be  used  by  another                                  project unless allowed by the VP for E\&BA. The borrowed funds                                  are paid back to the particular project.                                 Cash  accounting  is  followed  in  the  preparation  of  income                                  statement.                                 The  official  income  statement  is  prepared  by  the  accounting                                  office  (may  be  delegated  to  the  Facilitative  Staff  of  OBA)  every                                  end  of  the  production  cycle  as  basis  for  giving  incentives.                                  Incentives are given at the end of one production year.                                 Two  analyses  are  done  by  the  project  analyst–financial  (cash                                  accounting)  and  economic  (accrual  method).  The  economic                                                                                                             76","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          77                                   analysis is prepared for management decision-making while the                                  financial analysis is used as basis for giving incentives.                                 The  VP-EBA  and  the  Accountant  controls  disbursements  of                                  projects  funds  for  E\&BA.  The  Accountant  is  a  member  of  the                                  E\&BA Council, if organized.                     Section 2.  Sources of Funds                            a.     Internal Sources                                 Initial  budget  for  IGPs  may  come  from  Fund  101  under                                  Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (stated in NBC No.                                  331).                                 A  project  can  also  borrow  from  income  generated  from                                  agriculture  operation  (Fund161),  manufacturing  (Fund162),                                  auxiliary services (Fund163), and income from tuition fees, etc.                                  (Fund164).                             b.

Financial Management                                   The end product of the financial accounting process is a set of                           reports, which are called financial statements. The three (3) financial                           statements,  which  have  to  be  prepared  by  the  Project  Manager  and                           the Accountant every end of the period for submission to the VP for                           E\&BA,  are  the  following:  (a)  income  statement;  (b)  cash  flow                           statement, and (c) balance sheet. However, in the present government                           accounting  system,  only  the  income  statement  is  being  prepared                           among the three financial statements.                            A.      Income Statement                                          The income statement shows the results of operation of a                                  project  for  a  certain  period  of  time,  usually  a  month  (for  fast-                                  moving  projects,  i.e.  with  daily  sales  such  as  poultry  and                                  swine), or a production cycle (for projects like cattle). It shows                                  whether a net income is earned or net loss is incurred by the                                  project  during  the  period.

Net Income/ Loss – A net income is realized if the total                                          revenues generated during a certain production period is                                          greater  than  the  total  expenses  incurred  in  the  same                                          period in generating those revenues. On the other hand, if                                          the total expenses are greater than total revenues, a net                                          loss is incurred.                            B.     Cash Flow Statement                                  Aside  from  determining  the  profitability  of  a  project  by                           preparing the income statement and computing its net income during                           the period,  the adequacy and timeliness of the project‟s cash flows to                           attain  its  profit  objective  should  also  be  considered  and  determined                           through  the  cash  flow  statement.  Only  then  can  we  say  that  the                           project is financially feasible.

Balance Sheet                                          A balance sheet shows the financial status of a project as                                  of a specific date. It is usually prepared at the end of any given                                  production  period.  It  shows  the  different  assets  owned  by  the                                  project,  whether  it  be  its  own  equity  or  loan  from  financial                                  institutions.  The  total  value  of  asters  should  be  equal  to  the                                  sum of total liabilities and the total project‟s equity. Included in                                  the  total  project‟s  equity  are  the  retained  earnings  realized  by                                  the project in its previous operations.                                   a.  Assets-  An asset is anything that a project owns like cash,                                      receivables,  inventory  of  stocks,  feeds  and  supplies,  tools,                                      equipment and building.                                   b.  Liabilities       - is a financial obligation or a debt owed by a                                      project from financial institutions. Usually, a project resorts                                      to  borrowing  if  it  has  no  available  cash  to  purchase  the                                      inputs/supplies needed.                                   c. Project’s Equity          -  The  project‟s  equity  refers  to  all  the                                    things   owned and acquired by the project out of its retained                                    earnings during the period. Retained earnings refer to the net                                    income/profit  that  has  accumulated  during  the  previous                                    periods of project operation.

Profitability Analysis                                   To  evaluate/analyze  the  project‟s  profitability/viability,  some                                  ratios can be considered. These are as follows:                            1.     Return on working Capital           =             Net Income                                                                                 Operating Expenses                                           It is the ratio of the net income over project‟s working                                  capital  (equivalent  to  the  total  operating  expenses  incurred  in                                  generating the total revenues of the project) during the                                  production period.                            2.     Net Income  = Total Revenue – Total Operating Expenses                                  The  profitability  of  a  project,  regardless  of  its  size,  can  be                                  determined by considering its net income on a per unit basis, as                                  indicated below:                             3.

Break Even Analysis                                           The Project  Manager  should know the minimum level of                                  production  and  sales  volume  that  must  be  maintained  by  the                                  project to at least breakeven. The cost structure of the project                                  can  also  be  considered  in  setting  the  selling  price  and  the                                  desired profit in a given production period. To breakeven means                                  that the project will neither earn a net income/profit nor incur a                                  net loss in its operation.                                                                                                            83","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          84                                    Following  is  the  breakeven  model  that  can  be  used  in                           determining  the  desired  selling  price  and  production/sales  volume                           that would help achieves the project‟s objectives.                             1.  Breakeven Price (BEP)           =      Total Operating Expenses                                                                           Total Quantity Produced                                   This will give us the minimum selling price that we can offer to                           at least breakeven. It means that a net income/profit will be realized if                           we sell our products above this price, while a net loss will be incurred,                           if sold below the price.                            2.   Breakeven Volume  =                Total Operating Expenses                                                                              Proposed Selling Price                                   This will help us determine the minimum production level that                           should be produced and sold by the project to at least breakeven. It                           means that production above this level will help the project realize a                           net income. However, if production is below this level, a net loss will                           be incurred.                                   If the project wou ld like to attain its target net income/profit in                           a given production period, the following formulas will help guide the                           Project Manager:                            A.

Financial Management and Control System                                A typical issue regarding the financial aspect of IGPs is whether to                           continue with the existing government accounting method or to adopt                           the commercial accounting in this Manual.                                To  be  sure,  it  will  help  if  we  refer  back  to  the  twin  objectives  of                           IGPs, which consists of profit and instruction. It is assumed that the                           sustainable  profitability  of  IGPs  will  help  bolster  the  instruction                           aspect as it gives indisputable proof that the theories being advanced                           in the classroom have sound basis in the market place. Accordingly,                           the Manual proposes recognition of full costs as the only method that                           would give accurate  profitability indicators. Depreciation, bad debts,                           amortization of capital expenditure is items that should be found in                           the financial statements of the IGPs.                                Without  full  costing,  the  profitability  indicators  assure  IGP                           Managers,  Directors,  and  personnel  of  remuneration  without  being                           certain  that  this  is  reflective  of  their  contribution  toward  the                           attainment  of  IGP  objectives.  Thus,  under  existing  pay  scheme,  the                           government  ends  up  subsidizing  operations  that  are  not  financially                           feasible.  The bureaucratic layer thickens and additional benefits are                           given with little or no benefit to the government.                                It is also observed that the existing government accounting system                           encourages the proliferation of very small IGPs for welding operation,                           material testing etc. This is tolerated partly because of the desire to                           accommodate as many IGP managers as possible and partly because                           the existing accounting system does not adequately reveal the hidden                           cost and cost allocation problems associated with this set up.                                  Another  perceived  incompatibility  of  government  accounting                           with IGP operations is the need for strict adherence to establish the                           guidelines and procedures in purchasing supplies and materials. The                           manual  has  put  in  place  enough  mechanism  to  guarantee  the                           propriety  of  IGP  expenditures.  Tedious  documentation  and  other                           requirements will therefore serve no other purpose than to stifle the                           IGP or render it ineffective against its competitors; hence, the Manual                           proposes the use of commercial accounting for IGP operations.                                                                                                                    85","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          86                            a.       Procurement System                                  To  a  large  extent,  the  cost  and  availability  of  supplies  and                           materials  determine  the  salability  and  profitability  of  finished                           products.  Thus,  an  IGP  must  have  a  procurement  system  that                           possesses the following characteristics:                                              It must be reliable and fast.                                            It must be cost and quality sensitive.                                   Speedy determination of where to purchase what items in what                           quantities require that we do away with the usual government                            bidding  and  awarding  procedures.  For  capital  expenditure,  however,                           the Manual suggests that the usual government procedure should be                           observed.  The  same  shall  likewise  apply  to  purchase  of  semi-                           expendable purchases except when these are urgently needed by the                           IGP.                                   In  SUCs  with  many  but  small-scale  IGPs  it  would  be  cost-                           effective if centralized body within the facilitative staff will handle all                           purchases  based  on  the  approved  production  levels.  However,  in                           SUCs with several medium-to large-IGPs, a decentralized procurement                           body under the Project Manager will probably be more efficient.                                   Whether       the    procurement        system      is   centralized      or                           decentralized, its financial requirement will be made in the form of a                           cash advance to be liquidated as soon as the supplies and materials                           are produced. The amount of cash advance will depend on the type of                           IGP and production level. The Imprest Fund System shall be used as                           the  standard  procedure  in  granting  cash  advance.  A  checker  or                           quality control inspector will also have to be assigned from within the                           facilitative staff to ensure that quality requirements are complied with.                                   Aside from the quality aspect, the checker or inspector will also                           determine the appropriateness of the quantity and to a certain extent,                           the  price  of  the  items  produced  particularly  in  purchases  made                           outside  of  the  planned  production  level.  In  no  case  will  purchased                           items  be  admitted  into  production  without  passing  through  the                           checker or inspector.                                                                                                                  86","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          87                            b.        Receivable and Inventory Control System                                   As  a  strategic  tool,  the  IGP  Managers  should  be  able  to                           understand  and  utilize  credit  and  collection  as  well  as  inventory                           management  policies.  These  two  concepts  go  hand  in  hand  with                           procurement  policies  to  achieve  a  unified  system  that  controls  cost,                           assures quality and delivery requirements, and achieve sales targets.                                  1.      Credit and Collection Policies                                               IGP  credit  and  collection  policies  may  invoke  the                                                 following:                                               Quality of accounts accepted or the credit standard                                               Credit period                                               Cash discount or rebates                                               Special terms such as seasonal dating                                  Depending on the scale of production and the target market, the                           Business Council may set a  policy that only the faculty and staff of                           the college will be allowed to purchase on credit giving emphasis on                           the  relative  ease  and  security  of  collection  (automatic  salary                           deduction).  Sales  to  outside  clients  are  made  only  on  a  cash  basis.                           This policy sets the credit standard.                                   The credit terms will depend on the policies set by the Business                           Council in consultation with the Project Managers.                                   Cash discount or rebates may also be given as when there is an                           excess production or when sales are unexpectedly low and is expected                                  to continue in the near future. In extreme cases, the IGP may                           accept  seasonal  or  dated  payments  through  check  or  other  suitable                           negotiable instrument.                                   In  situations  where  the  IGP  sells  merchandise  or  services  on                           account,  especially  to  consumers  other  than  the  University  faculty                           and staff, bad debts  may have to be recognized and reflected in the                           financial statements.                                   The  IGP  Manager,  in  consultation  with  the  Business  Council                           and  the  accountant  shall  decide  the  manner  and  procedure  in  the                           aging  of  accounts  payable  and  writing  off  of  accounts  receivable  as                           bad  debts  expense.  Bad  debts  expense  shall  only  be  applicable  to                           receivables  from  outside  clients.

Inventory Control System                                   A good inventory control system is one that achieves a balance                           between avoiding stocks-outs (i.e., situation where an IGP runs out of                           items  to  sell)  and  controlling  levels  of  finished  products  in  the                           warehouse.                                  A  stock-out  means  lost  opportunities  for  both  actual  and                           prospective sales when dissatisfied customer may not come back for                           another purchase. On the other hand, maintaining too much stock                           would  mean  that  the  working  capital  is  tied  up  with  the  excess                           inventory.                                   In food production projects where there is risk of spoilage, the                           IGP Manager should have more creative ways to dispose the inventory                           at the shortest possible time. Having a captive market (the employees                           and students of the University) helps the IGP Manager in estimating a                           realistic level of production. The feasibility study is the primary source                           of these data. Once demand is firmly established, raw materials that                           would yield the desired production level can be easily estimated.                                   For manufacturing concerns, the case is a bit more complicated                           because  there  are  different  inventory  costs  at  various  stages  of                           production.  For  costing  purposes,  manufacturing  inventories  are                           broadly classified into:                                                  a. In transit or work process                                                 b. Raw materials                                                 c. Finished goods                                   Work-in-process inventory are those inventory in various stages                           of production but are not quite done yet. Raw materials inventory are                           the  basic  ingredients  required  to  produce  the  finished  products  or                           goods. Finished goods inventory refers to inventory that have gone to                           the  production  process.  It  possesses  the  required  direct  materials,                           direct labor and factory overhead. For all purposes, it is ready for sale.                                   In an ideal situation, inventories are sold as  soon as they are                           produced.  In  reality,  however,  a  manufacturing  concern  will  always                           run the risk of either producing more or less. A good control system                           permits  efficient  production  scheduling  and  utilization  of  resources.                           The  idea  is  to  avoid  additional  costs  due  to  production  delays  or                           overproduction.  The  system  should  also  allow  for  operational                           flexibility in its purchases so that storage and handling costs can be                           minimized if not totally eliminated.                                                                                                               88","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          89                                   Most manufacturing projects of SUCs are „job order‟ types, thus,                           eliminating  the  risk  of  excess  finished  goods.  This,  however,  runs                           counter to the idea of maximizing potential. Institutionalizing the “job                           order” system encourages IGP personnel to be complacent.                                   The  manual  is  thus  recommending  that  IGP  Manager  should                           take effort to determine market demand and incorporate the data into                           the sales plan and production budget they prepare.                                   The  IGP  Manager,  in  consultation  with  the  Business  Council                           and the Accountant, shall formulate policies regarding the disposal of                           unsaleable or stale merchandise. Price markdowns and bulk sales for                           food  items  may  be  resorted  to  where  practicable  except  when  the                           merchandise is no longer fit for consumption.                                   As  regards  obsolete  or  unserviceable  items,  disposal  thereof                           shall follow existing guidelines on unserviceable items. Setting of bid                           price,  however,  shall  consider  the  scrap  value  of  the  equipment  as                           reflected in the financial statements of the IGP.                                   Once  the  production  volume  is  determined  and  is  tested,  a                           reorder  point  should  be  established  to  determine  the  level  at  which                           inventories  are  allowed  to  fall  before  the  IGP  Manager  orders  or                           produces more.                                   The order point (IRP) considers the following factors:                                   1. Safety Stock (SS) – buffer inventory in case order is delayed                                          or     usage is higher than normal.                                  2.  Lead  Time  (LT)  –  the  time  interval  between  placing  and                                          receiving     order.                                  3. Estimated daily use (EDU)                                          The order point is computed using the formula:                                          IRP = SS (EDU x LT)                            Article 7.

Basic Requirements of Scholarship                            Scholars should enroll the required regular load during the semestral                    or summer classes. Regular load means twelve (12) units per semester, nine                    (9) units per trimester and quarterm, and six (6) units of academic subjects                    during summer. A load of nine (9)  units may be allowed during the initial                    semester  or  six  (6)  units  during  the  initial  trimester  or  quarterm  of                    coursework upon prior approval of the Scholarship Committee. The scholars                    should coordinate with the FSDO before finalizing their coursework in order                    to ensure that the load requirement is satisfied.                            In case the intended course to be enrolled is dissolved or has reached                    the quota for the required number of enrollees and no substitute course is                    allowed by the graduate committee, the scholar‟s stipend will be pro-rated                    based  on  his  load  during  the  semester/trimester.  The  scholar  will  be                    required to reinstate if he does not have any subject to enroll for reasons                    stated above.                     Section 8. Change of Specialization                             The selection of scholars is based on specific fields of specialization.                    The scholars cannot change their field of specialization or major course of                    work without prior authorization from the University. A change in the field                    of  study/specialization  and  school  shall  not  be  allowed  specially  if  it                    requires additional period of scholarship and additional expense on part of                    the University except in certain meritorious cases beyond their control. The                                                                                                            98","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          99                     unit  heads/deans  should  justify  that  the  change  would  benefit  their                    unit/college in particular and the University in general. If a faculty member                    pursued  a  program  authorized  by  the  University  but  which  is  not  in  line                    with his field of specialization or not needed by his college/unit, he will be                    required  to  transfer  to  another  college/unit  within  the  University  System                    that needs such field of study/specialization.                             A  scholar  who  changes  his  field  of  specialization  without  prior                    approval  will  be  required  to  reinstate  and  refund  in  full  all  expenses                    incurred during his scholarship to include tuition and other fees, stipend,                    book allowance, thesis allowance, salary and other financial incentives.                      Section 9. Leave of Absence                            A total maximum leave of absence equivalent to one school year may                    be granted to the faculty member or staff on scholarship upon prior request                    based on meritorious reasons subject to the submission of an approved LOA                    from  the  graduate  school  and  approval  of  the  University  President  upon                    recommendation of the Scholarship Committee. The scholar on LOA shall be                    required  to  reinstate  to  the  University  and  shall  not  be  entitled  to                    allowances  of  a  scholar.  The  period  of  reinstatement  is  good  only  for  the                    length  of  the  approved  LOA  unless  otherwise  approved  by  higher                    authorities.                     Section10. Length of Study                            Faculty members and staff on scholarship are allowed a maximum of                    two  (2)  years  to  finish  their  MA/MS/MBA/related  degrees  and  three  (3)                    years to finish their Ph.D./DBA/related degrees excluding the period of their                    approved LOA.                      Section 11. Extension of Scholarship                            Extension  of  scholarship  beyond  the  period  specified  in  Section  10                    may be allowed only for five (5) months with full privileges upon certification                    of the Adviser that the scholar can finish the course within the extension                    period  and  the  Scholarship  Committee  has  determined  that  normal  credit                    loads have been taken every semester. An additional extension for less than                    or  maximum  of  five  (5)  months  only  on  official  time  and  without  stipend                    could  be  granted  for  meritorious  reasons  and  certification  of  the  adviser                    and/or dean of the graduate school.                                                                                                               99","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          100                            In case of  completion of thesis or dissertation beyond the allowable                    scholarship period, (3 years for MS/MA/MBA and 4 years for Ph.D./DBA),                    the grantee shall be required to reinstate to the University while completing                    the thesis/dissertation requirements and is no longer entitled to scholarship                    privileges.

To  conduct  himself  in  a  manner  so  as  not  to  bring  disgrace  or                               dishonor to the University and to the country;                            b.  Any  misconduct  such  as  immorality,  assault  on  authority,                               excessive  drunkenness,  inciting  rebellion  or  sedition  or  a                               combination of the same, and acts not in conformity with the Code                               of Conduct for Government Employees (RA 6713) are grounds for                               immediate  termination  of  scholarship,  pending  investigation  and                               subsequent  legal  proceedings  against  the  scholar  in  accordance                               with Civil Service and other government rules and regulations;                            c.  To keep up with the high standards of scholarship;                                       The  grantee  should  understand  that  scholarship  is  both  a                               privilege and a responsibility. It is the responsibility of a scholar to                               behave  as  a  responsible  scholar  at  all  times.  He  is  therefore                               required  to  maintain  a  grade  point  average  of  2.00  for  graduate                               courses  (or  their  equivalent  requirements)  at  the  end  of  every                               semester. A GPA below these requirements shall automatically lose                               his scholarship slot. Fees paid for courses with INC. which are not                               completed  /  graded  within  the  allowed  period  of  completion,                               should  be  refunded  and  the  pro-rated  amount  of  stipend  for  the                               said period would be deducted from the succeeding stipends.                            d.

Funding and Resource Development/Financial Management                                   The  UPRC  was  put  up  on  the  assumption  that  it  is  self                           liquidating. However, because it is still new, initial funds should come                           from a portion of the University budget. However, additional funds will                           later  come  from  the  review  fees  the  amount  of  which  will  vary                           depending on the program, college and from year to year. The fees will                           be deposited to the account (trust) of UPRC and these shall be used to                           defray  the  cost  of  review  materials,  honoraria  of  reviewers  and                           technical  management  group  or  personnel  and  other  incidental                           expenses.  Income  that  will  be  generated  will  be  used  in  the                           procurement of equipment and supplies for smooth operation of the                           Center.                                   Since  the  UPRC  is  in  its  infancy stage,  proposals  for  resource                           generation and budget allocation will be prepared.                                   After  each  review  program,  financial  report  and  operating                           expenses shall be reported by the Unit concerned to the  UPRC.   All                           financial  transactions  shall  be  noted  by  the  college  dean,  to  be                           recommended  by  the  UPRC  director  and  approved  by  the  VPAA                           and/or the University President.                      Article 5. Incentives                            A.     Board Passers                                           Board  passers  will  be  given  recognition  on  form  of                                  streamers  and  testimonial  lunch/dinner.  Board  placers  will                                  receive  plaques  of  recognition  and  cash  incentives  of  Php                                  10,000.00 each for top 1 to 3 while PhP 5,000.00 each for top 4                                  to 10.                            B.     Reviewers                                           Reviewers  will  receive  an  honorarium  of  ideally  500  to                                  1,000  pesos  per  hour  but  this  will  depend  on  the  number  of                                  reviewees  and  available  funds  to  support  the  giving  of                                  honorarium  and  other  operating  expenses.  Therefore,  if  the                                  number of reviewees did not meet the quota, lesser amount of                                  honorarium will be given to reviewers.                                                                                                                 243","CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS                    ______________________________________________________________________                                                                                                          244                                   Reviewers  may  also  be  given  cash  incentive  for  every                                  module/review material prepared and published.

Article 6.  Data Bank                                   UPRC  will  serve  as  depository  of  all  review  materials  and                                  relevant pieces of information pertaining to the operation of the                                  Review Center. Likewise, records of all takers and board passers                                  in all campuses will be its main concern.                      Article 7.
