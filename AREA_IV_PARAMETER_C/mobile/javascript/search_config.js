What is the most important lesson in life that you have learned during your stay at                CvSUTreceMartires City Campus?                 The most important lesson i’ve learned at CvSU is to be goal digger, to be an effective way to my co-                student, to share my idea without conditions and last, to be competitive in all aspects because I  know                that I can do anything with a good heart, good decision and good mindset.                Lahat ng paghihirapmapapagtagumpayan                Be patient all the time.                being resposible at all time                Do not give up until you achieve your goal","Being competitive at the same time be better version of yourself.                morally upright, globally competitive, being honest, opstimistic, and patience                \" no matter how hard the situation is, just study and strive and do not quit. \"                I learned to manage time, I learned how to socialize with different people and especially I learned how                to stand on my own two feet without relying on other people                Enjoy yet be responsible                The important lesson in life that I learned in staying to CVSU is we need to know how to get along with                a classmate that I can use when I have found a job and be friendly.                Hard working and responsible                Work hard and be competitive in a right way.                Whatever obstacles may come along your way, like dust in our new school building go with the flow                and dont give up while achieving your dreams.                study hard to graduate and most of all do not give up                Being independent and put alot of knowledge of this school                To be globally competitive and morally upright individual.                To be morally upright individual                Need to study hard if want to get highier grade.                The most important lesson in life that I have learned in this university is by being competitive and being                independent because not all the people around you will help you in times of need.                I've never forgotten about how you can value your time and effort in making your life worth.                Most important lesson in life is you must believe that if they can, so can you                Learn as much as you can, that doesn't mean studying all the time, it is important schedule time for fun                and to take a break to keep your mind fresh and clear                Magingmabuti                Being a globally competetive individual                Madami po akongnatutunansacvsutrecetulad ng pagigingisangmabutingkaibigan at                mabaitsakapwamadami man po akongkalokohannanagawatulad ng pagigingpasawaysaklase at pala                absent mas nangibabawnaman po ungsaya.                The important lesson I have learned during my stay at CvSU is that staying at school is an investment                for the future. You have to continue what you've start for your dream, because at the end of the day                you will be successful and proud to your self.                Proper use of time management                Be strong and never give up on the things or dreams you want to achieve.                The importance of time.                Never give up                Treasure the time                Life doesn't get easier. Not all things will work out the way you planned but always desire to learn                something useful.                Never give up in pursuing your dreams.                Time manage .                Trust yourself, help yourself and aim for success                Love of work                Hardships comes with success.                The most important thing in life that I've learned in my journey in CvSUTreceMartires City Campus is                that I am not alone with my journey. My classmates became my sisters and brothers at school, listening                and being with me when I have problems. Even if I'm a cry baby and a not so talkative person, they still                accepted me for who I am. The instructors became our second parents. They keep on supporting us on                what we wanted to do and motivate us not to give up on something we want to achieve. They never                failed to show us their support to our talents and potentials. The knowledge and skills that we have","learned during our stay were really a treasure but the friendship that was made with pure intentions,                over flowing love and support from the instructors, challenges that we conquered and the happiness                that I felt from all those experiences were the things that will stay in my heart forever.                In our course, the lesson in life that I have learned during my stay in the campus is that rather than                doing it alone, working and brainstorming together as a group will achieve a more effective and efficient                result.                Teamwork while during any big activities like pre-employment seminar and culminating activities.                The eagerness/willingness to learn despite the lack of facilities/resources                I learned to socialize with my co-students, professors and staffs with different status in life, and became                treasurer in League of Young Hotelier and Restaurateur (LYHR) 2019. I also learned that age gap is                not a hindrance in achieving my goal to finish my study in college.                Self-sustainability and Self-sufficiency                be a professional and give effort to all gain your goal                Rely on your self                adaptability                Always Do your best                Time management and decision making                Work hard for you goals                 most important lesson i've learned in CVSU is to never give up even if the course is not easy                 To be on time                Encourage your self                even though theres so much struggling we face, it can't stop us to attend to school just to learn and                strive more to reach our goal (to graduate) i have learn that, it doesn't matter if your school is small,                atleast we learn. thanks to our professors who encourage us to keep on fighting in our studies and                teach us to be better on our fields.                Don't too rush the projects, just think about the best to see what the perfect/good result.                you have to work hard for your dreams                Give all the best in what you are doing                Competitive, Focus and fellowship.                Make every moment count                The most valuable efforts are the ones never recognized.                Self-study is a key to learn                Give respect                Hardwork and Teamwork                Perseverance                I learned to always look at the bright side of things.                Morally upright and time management                The most important lesson that I learned in CVSU Trece is yung wag ka umasasaiba, katuladna lang                pagwalangmga prof na mag tuturo, dapathindipalalahatiaasasakanila, kasihindinamanlagisilangnadyan                para mag turo o tulungan ka,                dapatmatutunanmotumayosasarilimongmgapaananghindiumaasasakanila.

I have learned to be somehow independent when it comes to learning. The significance of self-studying                was emphasized during my stay in CvSU. Aside from the fact that Instructors are not always present,                the lessons are too broad, so, i have to explore more of it by myself.                Time management                Believe in yourself that anything is possible                Learn to trust others especially yourself","One of the most important lesson I've learned is how to balance ,how to prioritize .Life is about                balancing your job , family, friends,lovelife,and personal time .                communication and technical skills and also commitment                Self-esteem                Different fundamentals in different subjects.                Be Patient.. All things work together for good                 D.  Have  you  encountered  any  problems  during  your  whole  stay  here  at                CvSUTreceMartires City Campus?

Also, in sports fest week, there are so many                winners but they don’t give the respective medals for us.

But I really had a hard time adjusting to the new location of the                school. For me, the location is much better before. The noise you can hear from other rooms became a                problem for me because I can't really focus on the discussion. I have a hard time adapting to the new                location. But, I think there can be an improvement on this because of the new plans that the school                have. Lastly, the instructor/s with favoritism and being biased.

Yes, I've met a new gay instructor who is a maniac and he is using his position to manipulate students.                I have never been his victim. I am a pure \& I am a Christian so I rather failed my subjects than selling                my dignity.

N/A                I hope students can have a better facilities and materials that they can use for their studies.                I am worried with the physical facilities because when someone is running at the 2nd floor, you can                really feel the building is kinda shaking. You can hear noises to adjacent rooms. And when it's raining,                some rooms have mud on the floors.                Personally, i think the physical facilities of the whole school is the problem. You cannot focus on class                because of the noises in the adjacent room. The weather is also a factor. When summer, you cannot                focus in class because it is too hot that sometimes resulted in passing out of spme students. The                restrooms are not decent and clean and the roads are not in cement, so when it rains it really hard to                walk to school.                Need some improvement in the restroom, hallways and in rooms in the second floor it is shakin when                someone is running.

Cahoy            The  proliferation  of the COVID-19  hardly  strikes  different  sectors  of  our         country,  from  the  people  to  the  state.  The  four  sections  of  the  economy,         monetary flow inside the country, different industries that create a workplace  for         people, environment sustainability, especially to our health, and even  education.         It  is  just  like  our  world  had  stopped  for  a  minute  or  two  due  to  the  rapid         emergence of this virus. Every Filipino people from different social levels  of the         society  even  those  who  are  in  the bottom  line  is not  an  exemption  from  the         effects of this pandemic. The “high-brows” also cannot think of ways on  how         we  can  still  go  on  in  our  life  in  the  course  of  this  pandemic,  especially  the         opening  of  classes  for  SY  2020-2021  but  there  is  always  a  solution  for         everything.            August  14,  2020,  President  Rodrigo  Duterte  declared  the  opening  of         classes  for  the  school  year  2020-2021  will  be  on  October  5,  2020.  It  was  his         answer  concerning  the  recommendation  submitted  by  DepEd  Undersecretary         and  Spokesperson  Atty.  Nepomuceno  Malaluan  on  August  6,  2020.  This         decision  made  by  the  President  and  the  Department  of  Education  had  gone         through numerous deliberations and preparations before they had come up with         this  final  verdict.  Many  people,  specifically  Filipino  mothers  are  fascinated         about how their children can continue studying in midst of the COVID 19. As         we  can  remember,  last  July  17,  2020,  President  Rodrigo  Duterte  signed  the         Republic  Act No. 11480 that amends  the Republic  Act 7797  which mandates         the opening  of classes between the first Monday  of June until  the last  day of         August. It states that the school year must start on the first Monday of June but         not later than the last day of August. It was also provided that the Secretary of                                                                                    Digital Poster by Central Student Government         Education may also set a different start date of the school year in the country  due         to an event of the declaration of a state of emergency. After calculating the  pros   opening of class views the tertiary level as an exemption. As an answer to this,         and cons, the Department of Education, despite the Coronavirus disease  2019   Commission on Higher Education Chairperson Prospero de Vera III said that  the         pandemic,  has  set  the  opening  of  classes  for  the  school  year  2020-2021  on    higher  education institutions  were  allowed to adjust their approved  academic         August 24, 2020, but was suddenly rejected by President Duterte himself until  a   calendars given the coronavirus pandemic. The decision of opening  the class in         vaccine against the virus becomes available. He said that he will not allow  any   tertiary  education  is  mandated  to  the  administration  of  every  college  and         face to face interaction in school to prevent the virus from spreading. In  answer   university as it was covered to the CHED Law or the Republic Act No.  7722         to  this,  DepEd  said  to  implement  a  blended  learning  program  wherein  the   which states that it allows colleges and universities to exercise their  academic         learning process will be set to modules, televisions, radios, and the internet  as a   freedom,  such  as  the  opening  of  classes.  According  to  De  Vera,  universities         medium of instruction. Meanwhile, there is also a proposal to conduct  limited   open their school year as approved by their board depending on the  way they         face to face classes in the areas under lockdown measures and modified  general   structure  their  semesters,  as  well  as  their  level  of  preparedness  amid  the         community quarantine. Citizens from that time were confused about  when is the   pandemic.  He  also  added  that  all  universities  and  colleges  can’t  open  their         proper date for the opening of classes. Many things are needed to  consider and   school year at the same time as they differ in terms of their academic calendars.                                                               In  consideration  of  this,  colleges  and  universities  should  still  work         for them to start again into scratch represents the passion to go on  and to still                                                               collaboratively  with  the  IATF  and  assess  the  students  as  well  as  teachers’         fight. Until the  Inter-Agency Task Force appears in the picture,  wherein they                                                               capability  in  distance  mode  learning.  The  Cavite  State  University-  Trece         recommend to start the reopening of schools in September.

After  tuning  in  the  television,        listening to radio reports, and checking on different        social  media  platforms,  news  of  the  Taal  Volcano        eruption  circulated  as  fast  as  its monstrous  strike.        From a serene tiny volcano to an extreme madman-        like behavior posing danger to all the neighboring        areas.        •  Since  its  last  eruption  43  years  ago  in  1977,        nobody  expected  that  the  Taal  volcano  will  again        display its violent strength. According to  PHILVOLCS        Director  Dr.  Renato  Solidum,  the  volcano  started        seismic activities around 11 am and  finally erupted        at 1 pm Philippine Standard Time.  It was ultimately        advised  to  avoid  settlement  near  Taal,  as  the        concerned  agency  spontaneously  raised  the        volcanoes’ alert level from Level 2 at 2:30 pm  due        to its steam-driven, phreatic  eruption, then  turned        Alert Level 3 at 4 pm indicating “magmatic  unrest’,        and was raised further to Alert level 4  (hazardous        eruption  imminent)  at 7:30  pm  in  which  the  ash        and  rock  fragments  had  reached  up  to 10-15  km        due to its continuous eruption, thus placing  Cavite        and  Batangas  under  “state  of  calamity”.  Volcanic        alert  level  status  starts  from  level  1  being  the        lowest, and alert level 5 being the highest, in  which        Taal  volcano,  the  worlds’  smallest  supervolcano        and one of the most dangerous, is  capable of.        •   Taal’s      volcanic      activities     continuously        •   progressed,   resulting   in   severe   earthquakes   in    Photo by Atty.

Why there is a rainbow after the rain?          Honestly, being love is the greatest part of our life,         It is one of our fuel to live,         Like a plant that needs water to grow,         Always brings us hope.          Love gave us a different kind of emotions,         Like reading a fairytale story before going to sleep,         Like a flower in the garden that blooms from         within,         Bringing us to such a wonderful feeling.          Love is a Hope, a gift from above,         It motivates us to go farther from our dreams.         It gives us vitamins to step on and hold on to,         It's guiding us to reach our goal.          Love teaches us that there is always a Hope,         In our Study, In our Career, and, In our Life.         We can be whoever we wanted to be,         If there's a Storm in our path,         there's a rainbow in the end.         Along with Love, Hope exists.
